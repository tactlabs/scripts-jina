showTwo-And-Half-MenjæiEditor: Jk2writ. Thanks, Mom. This is a perfect first job for him. First job. I think you're looking a. the birth of a career. I was gonna have him put up fliers. but I didn't trust him with a staple gun. - How much are you paying him. - Obviously too much, look at him. For the record, I promised him $2. and a Playboy magazine. Playboy. Don't worry. I'll Magic Marke. over the ta-tas and hoo-hoos. Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels. I should have hired a monkey. You mean a different monkey. So Little Jughead's earning a paycheck. Well, it's not really a paycheck. and he's not really earning it. And we don't call him... I guess I gotta give you Jughead. I remember my first job. Slaughterhouse. Stripping out sheep intestine. for the condom companies. Not as sexy as it sounds. I was a fluffer in a pet salon. You know, with a blow-dryer. Huh. I was goin. a completely different way. What are you doing. Thanks to Grandma, I'm readin. an interview with Jimmy Kimmel. - Hey, Alan, you got any cash. - Yeah, why. - I need to borrow some. - What for. What are you, my mother. Just give me a few bucks. save me a trip to the ATM. - When will I get it back. - I don't know. Tomorrow. Okay. How much do you need. Just a couple hundred. A couple hundred. Who carries around that kind of money. Well, let's see. Strippers, bookies, prostitutes... ...and not entirely coincidentally, me. Well, I've only got, uh, 35... Uh, $38. That's it. That's your walking-around money. It's the perfect amoun. in case I get mugged. Not so little that my attacke. would get angry and pistol-whip me... ...yet not so muc. that I would fight for it... ...and possibly get sho. while wrestling for the gun. - So you got $38. - Yup. Just out of curiosity... ...how much money would it tak. to wrestle a gun from a mugger. Assuming a small- to medium-sized mugger. at least 40. Fine. So give me the 38. - All of it. - Why not. - Then I've got nothing. - And you think $38 changes that. What if I decide to go ou. and have some fun. Thirty-eight dollars won'th of fun. I wouldn't spend all of it. Okay. Okay, look. You're not going out to have fun. You never go out to have fun. Becaus. you know why? You're not a fun guy. Oh, I am very much a fun guy. We jus. have very different definitions of "fun"... ...and mine doesn't includ. urinary-tract infections and dry heaving. Just give me the money, you big fruit. Thirty-eight dollars... If it had been 40. we'd be wrestling, my friend. Hey, Charlie. You got my money. Charlie. I'm trying to sleep, Alan. I've gotta go to wor. and you said you'd have my money. - Oh, for God's sake. - You don't even have to get up... ...just tell me where it is. Well, the last I saw any of it... ...it was sandwiched between tw. of the loveliest man-made breasts... ...that ever smacked me in the eye. Oh, Charlie, you say the sweetest things. Oh, Ginger, this is my brother, Alan. Alan, Ginger. Hi. Hi. So bottom line. you don't have my money. - No. - The money you promised... ...to pay back today. - Today hasn't even started yet. - It started for me. That's only becaus. you're on douchebag savings time. Can we please talk about this... ...when one of us doesn't have a warm. firm buttock nestled against his groin. Oh, dear Lord. So you'll get it by tonight. I'm hoping to get i. as soon as you close the door. You really out of cash. Don't worry, I got hooker money. When you're hungry at schoo. You need to kno. Paste, ye. Boogers, n. - Hey. - How was your day, darling. Fine. Except I had to pay for lunc. with my lucky Sacagawea dollar. What kind of lunc. can you get for a dollar. Two gas station hot dogs... ...that were a year old if they were a day. thank you very much. Is Sacagawea the same Indian chic. that's on the Land o' Lakes butter. I don't know. I hope so. I'd like to believe it is. Okay, Charlie. I'm leaving. Hang on. Let me pay you. There you go. You forget I pai. for that pizza the other night. Oh, right. How much was that. Well, you got the garlic balls too. so say, 75 bucks. - You got change for a hundred. - Nope. - Okay, you'll pay me back. - Count on it. Wait, wait, wait. As long as you'r. doling it out, you got my 40 bucks. - Oh, sure. You got change for a hundred. - Nope. - Okay, I'll catch you later. - Wait. How come Berta can pay you bac. and I can't. Oh, grow up. She's not gonna pay me back. Okay, then what about me. - What about you. - I want my $40. I only borrowed 38. Yeah, well, I find round number. easier to remember. - You like round numbers, do you. - Yeah, I like round numbers. Okay, here's a round number for you. Zero. Nice, tight circular shape. Nothing gets in, nothing gets out. Sound familiar, Alan. Are you calling me a**l. That's right. A-L-A-N. "a**l. . Okay, okay, okay. So bottom line... ...you're not gonna pay me back. Is that correct. Well, truth be told. I was gonna pay you back... ...but your attitude irks me. - I irk you. - That's right. I find you irksome. You're a big, fat irk. Hey, hey. You borrow 38 dollars. you owe me 38 dollars. Yeah, well, you've been livin. in my Malibu beach house for six years. You owe me 1 million dollars. A million dollars. That's a one followed b. six tight little sphincters. Wow. - You look tired. - Yesterday, I had a quarter tank of gas. Today, I drive a mile into Topanga Canyon. and bang, empty. Huh. There's no cell coverage up there. So I had to hump back to the beac. to call Triple A. - Oh, that's a shame. - Shame, my ass. How the hell did a quarter tank of ga. disappear overnight. It's a mystery. Wait a minute. I smell gasoline. Really. I don't smell anything. You have gas on your breath. You siphoned my tank. Ah, oh, please. You think I stuck a rubber hos. down your gas tank... ...sucked on it until the gas ran ou. of your tank and into mine... ...thereby compensating m. for the $38 you owe me. That's preposterous. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. What was I thinking. What are you doing. Do me a favor. Say... ..."preposterous" again. Hey, you're crazy. Get that away from me. Oh, come on. Come on. Just for grins, say. "Help me. My head's on fire. . All right, all right. I sucked the ga. out of your car. Now, turn that off. Okay, fine. Well played. You got your money back. Uh. Actually, uh, at 473.9 cents a gallon... ...you had only $ 13 and 22 cents won't. in your tank. So you still owe me 24.78. - Get out. - What. Get out of my house. You know what? I just might. No, no, no. "Might" implies you have a choice. Oh, so you're gonna throw me ou. over 24 dollars and 78 cents. No, I'm throwing you out becaus. you're a cheap, gas-sucking, flammable irk. I am not cheap. Leaving. Ow, ow! Hot, hot. It's no one's fault, Jake. These things just happen. I don't know. they seem to happen to you a lot. Oh. Hey, guys. What are you doing here. Dad pissed off Uncle Charlie again. Uh, sorry to show u. unannounced like this. Oh, no problem. It's always good to see you. He got kicked out again. - Damn it, Alan. What did you do now. - Oh, I didn't do anything. But I'm not gonna be stayin. at Charlie's anymore... ...so I thought I should brin. Jake's stuff back here... ...until I find a place of my own. - Fine. Good luck. Uh, but it's nobody's fault. I just think it's time for me to move on. Okay. Good night. But FYI, Charlie's a thief, a liar. and I suspect something of a firebug. Really? Hmm. He always struck me as a straight-shooter. A little loosey-goosey with the liquo. and the ladies, but all in all a good fella. In what univers. is Charlie Harper a good fella. Well, I certainly don't know hi. as well as you do... ...so I'll just shut my pie hole. Uh, anyway, uh. here's the rest of Jake's stuff. Uh, I'll get you my new addres. as soon as I have one. - You do that. - Okay. - So where are you gonna stay till then. - Pie hole, Herb. Oh, I don't know. Uh, things are . little tight right now... ...so a hotel isn't really a. option, you know. Maybe the... The Y for a couple o. days, you know. Uh, but we'll see. I could, uh, sleep in my office. Uh... or in the car. - Oh, you can't do that. - Pie hole, pie hole, pie hole. Come on, Judith, you can't expect the ma. to sleep in his car. You're good people. Just let me get a few things. It'll be fine. He's not the kind of gu. who will overstay his welcome. He's been at his brother's for six years. Uh, Herb, would you mind giving me a han. with the Nordic Track? It's... oh, sure. Love you. - Hey, Charlie. - Oh, hey, Herb. What's up. I came to pick up some stuff for Alan. - For Alan. - Yeah, he's staying with Judith and I... ...till he gets back on his feet. Gee, Herb. I hate to be the bearer of bad news... ...but I've been waiting six years for tha. khaki-wearing weasel to get on his feet. Yeah, Judith mentioned that. Using a lot of the same words. interestingly enough. He wanted to avoid having a scene. so he asked if I'd pick up some of his stuff. - And you agreed. - I had to get out of there, Charlie. Okay, okay, fine. What do you need. Oh, quite a few things, actually. He gave me a list. Well, let him stay there long enough. he'll give you a bleeding ulcer. Judith said that too. Anyway, uh... ..."Melatonin, a mouth guard... . I guess he grinds his teeth at night. I myself have restless leg syndrome. But just the left leg. right leg sleeps like a baby. What else, Herb. . . . . Well, I also got apne. and I tend to drool a lot. - The list, Herb. - Oh, right, yeah. Let's see, uh... ..."A shower cap, a loofa mitt. . And some sort of little stoo. that elevates his feet... ...while he's sitting on the toilet. - What. Yeah, when the morning coffe. doesn't do the job... ...having his feet up gives him that extr. leverage for a successful bowel movement. - You're kidding. - No. Look. "For a successful BM.. That would mean "bowel movement. . Okay, fine. Uh, guest bedroom's right down there. Oh. Hey, I just made a pitcher of margaritas. You want one. Gee, I'll have to pass. Judith's waiting for m. to get back, and she gets really steamed... - Salt or no salt? You got it. - Salt. Okay. This is so weird. It's just for a couple of days, Jake. Don't make a federal case. This is probably gonna affec. my schoolwork. How? It's not lik. your grades could get any lower. That's good, Alan. Undermine his self-esteem. You see what I have to live wit. on weekends. Nobody's talking to you. Where is he gonna sleep. I'm not a he, I'm your father. How'd you get to be my fathe. if you're not a he. We'll make up the couch. What about the guest room. That's not a guest room anymore. it's Herb's train room. - His what. - He's a model-train aficionado. - Aficionado. - He works hard. He deserves a hobby. Sometimes he lets me wear the hat. I begged you for year. to let me turn that into a game room. - Bumper pool, Ping-Pong, something. - Well, this is different. - How. - Herb can play with his trains alone. I'm sure he does plenty of stuf. in there alone. - Excuse me. - Nothing. I got it. This is so beautiful. Yup. Can I confess something, Charlie. What's that. I sometimes wonder abou. the road not taken. Which road is that. Your road, Charlie. Oh. It's a good road, Herb. So it's not a matter o. "the grass always seems greener". No, no. No, the gras. is pretty freaking green over here. Damn. Oops. That's me. I would hope so. It's the road taken. - You're not gonna answer it. - No. - Judith will just harsh my mellow. - Yeah. She's a mellow harsher. But I love her. That's nice. You know, in the boudoir. we're very simpatico. Glad to hear it. On top of everything else... ...she actually let me put my train se. in her back room. Damn cran-apple juice. I should start wearing a diaper. - It's about time you got home. - Mmm. Is that an apology I'm feeling. Oopsie. - Where's my husband. - Sleeping on the deck. - What? Why. - He's drunk. Herb's not a drinker. No argument there. All right, here's how it's gonna go. I am taking him home with me. and you are taking back your brother. How about this. You and Alan patch things u. and I keep Stretch out there. I've grown kind of fond of the big lug. Charlie, I'm in no mood. - That's not what I heard. - What. I don't have time for this. Alan, get in here. No. - Do not make me come get you. Now, apologize to your brother. Do it. I'm sorry I mad. such a big deal of everything. And. And you... You can keep th. 24 dollars and 78 cents. - This was all about $24. - Plus he tried to set me on fire. After he sucked my gas. Hey, baby. When did you arrive on the scene. Just get in the car. Look, a poop stool. Um, I'm... I'm... I'm gonna need that. Well, you can pop a blood vesse. if you push too hard. Words to live by. Mm-hm. Herb, car. - Bye, Charlie. - Bye, Herb. - Bye, Alan. - Bye, Herb. - This was fun. Let's do it again. - Now. Kind of like old times, huh. Judith kicking me ou. and you taking me in. You are taking me in, aren't you. Give me one good reason why I should. Uh, well, we... We're... We're family. Uh, brothers. We share blood and... And... And history. We have a bond that unites us forever. No, what else you got. Okay, uh... ...what about my French toast. You like that. You know, uh. thick and fluffy with cinnamon... ...and powdered sugar. Mmm. - All right, you can stay. - Really. No. Very funny. Ha, ha. Charlie. You changed the locks. I was only gone for six hours. Charlie. Oh, crap. Here you go. Black, two sugars. Double glazed. - Thank you. - No, thank you. I can't believe Grandma fired me. Well, buddy, the labor market'. very competitive these days. There's always somebod. brighter and better willing to work for less

episode(&Episode-01-Taterhead is Our Love ChildjÐjEditor: Jk2writ. He can type 80 words a minut. with his thumb... ...but he can't pe. without hitting the shower curtain. Well, fortunately, typing is a job skil. and peeing is not. Oh, dude, WTF. - Oh, jeez. - What. That woman over there. we used to go out. Did it not end well. Hey, it went fine for me. Although, in retrospect... ...I guess I could've handled our parting, uh. with a little more tact and sensitivity... ...and a little less, you know. banging her best friend. Oh, God. Hey, the friend was a double-jointe. s*x freak with daddy issues. What was I supposed to do. - You're right, your hands were tied. - That too. So how long ago was this. Her or the friend. Because there was a brief overlap. Let's go with her. - I don't know, eight, nine years. - Hmm, so maybe she's over it. Or maybe not. Here's the plan. I'm gonna g. to the bathroom. You count to 10... ...then scream like a girl and start givin. Jake the Heimlich maneuver. Don't be ridiculous. - Charlie. - Hi. Okay. If she reaches into her purse. I'm using numbnuts as a human shield. - Hey. Chrissy, long time. - I know. - Yep, long, long time. Yeah. - Time is a great healer, isn't it. - Of some things. - Hey, congratulations on your new career. - Thank you. It's hard to believe Charlie Harpe. is a childrers singing star. Well, you know how much I love kid... Yep, long, long time. Uh, looks like your little guy enjoys music. Oh, yeah, he loves it. He's actually quite the piano player too. Piano? You, uh...? You hear that, Charlie. - Young man plays piano just like you. - Lots of kids play piano. So you still living in Westwood. Yeah. We just drove dow. to spend the day at the beach. Oh, sure, the beach. Heh. Nice place to visit. but you wouldn't wanna live there. - Actually, I do live there. It's not that bad. - Right. Well, we should get going. It was nice seeing you. - Nice to see you too. - Come on, Chuck. - Chuck. - I heard it. Ahem. Lots of kids named Chuck. - It's a nickname for Charles, isn't it. - So are Chaz, Chad, Chick, and Charlie. - What's your point. - No point. It's just that you haven't seen that woma. in nine years, and little Chuck is, uh... Well, how ol. do you suppose little Chuck is. What difference does it make. Well, I'd say little Chuck is, uh, hmm... ...7 or 8 years old. give or take nine months. What? I don't kno. what you're talking about. - You don't. - Okay, I choose not to. Oh, crap. Quick, Dad, we gotta go home. - Why? What's wrong. - My battery died. Oh, no, wait. I just turned it off by accident. This wouldn't happe. if I had a Smartphone. Do I even need to say it. So is it just me or did that ki. kind of look like Uncle Charlie. - Hey. - Hey. Shut up, Alan. It's not funny. Well, maybe not funny, ha, ha. but certainly funny. - That boy was nothing like me. - He doesn't have ear hair... ...and whiskey breath. but I'm guessing he'll grow into that. What's going on. Well, it would appea. that the old sperminator here... ...has fathered a child. - I did not. - How can you be so sure. Because I never play in the rai. without a slicker and galoshes. I'm confused. Where do the galoshes go. It's just a figure of speech. Everything that needs to be covered... ...is covered, when, you know. covering is appropriate. I didn't ask for your life story. I was just confused about the galoshes. You know, Charlie, even condom. are only 98-percent effective. - That's not true. - The hell it isn't. - Havert you ever read the package. - Who reads the package. It's not like a cereal box. You don't read it while you're eating. Yikes. You haven't seen the woman in nine years. and she's got an 8-year-old. So? You showed up at my doo. with a 10-year-old... ...and I hadrt seen you in 11 years. Does that mea. Taterhead is our love child. Yeah, fine, stay in denial. There's no way little Chuck is your son. - Chuck. - Hey, hey. Lots of kids are named Chuck. play the piano... ...and look disturbingly like me. He's right. In fact, I'm surprise. we're not up to our asses in them. - Hey, Russell. - I'm busy. I got a question about these condoms. Look, I told you, Charlie. I'm giving you the best bulk rate I can. I know, but that's not what I was... There's no way I can compet. with the chain stores. - I understand. - So I make it up in personal service. - I'm sure you do. - I'm not gonna unroll the damn things... ...and put them on for you. but short of that, I've got your back. And I appreciate it. But that's not what I was asking about. Charlie, times are tough. People don't get their drugs... ...from their neighborhood pharmacis. anymore. They go on the Internet. - I know. - Yeah, sure, trust your mailman... ...with your heart medicin. and stool softeners. Russell, have you been hittin. the free samples again. What are you, a cop. No. I'm just a little concerned about you. Well, if you're so concerned. help me out a little bit. Why don't you buy some reading glasse. or a neck brace once in a while. - Sure, whatever. - A bag of Skittles, for God's sake. You know, because my margi. on condoms is bubkes. Yeah. Well, speaking of condoms. I just wanna know... ...if somebody could get pregnan. even if you were wearing a condom. Have you been talkin. to the Wetzel's pretzels lady. Because I just gave her a ride home. that's it. No, no, no. I mean in general. What ar. the odds that a condom wouldn't work. Well, there are a number of thing. to factor in. Ah. - Oh, cough syrup. - I don't have a cough. Neither do I. Anyway, condoms. Whenever you're dealin. with a manufactured product... ...there's always gonna be flaw. in the process. Yeah, but aren't they supposed to be teste. before they go out, or in. - Well, sure, but they don't test every one. - They don't. m*st*rb*t*ng's looking bette. and better, huh. Okay. Okay, so bottom line. what you're saying is... ...even if I'm wearing a condom, there'. a chance I could get someone pregnant. Did you mis. eighth-grade health class, Charlie. Oh, come on, who went to health class. Well, amongst others. a certain self-medicating pharmacist... ...who pays alimon. to three different women... ...but not one penny in child support. All right. All right. For future reference. what about lambskin. Are they more effective. Well, um, less so than your latex product. Now, I had to sto. wearing them myself... ...because something about the smel. made my cat go berserk, ha, ha. - It's kind of a cute story. She was... - I don't wanna hear it. Not a cat person, huh. I'm not either anymore. All right, well, thanks, Russell. I'll see you. That's it? You're not gonna buy anything. I mean, we got some Wiffle-ball bats. Maybe your little b*st*r. would like a Wiffle-ball bat. Childproof cap. - Hey. - Hey. Are you all right. - No, I am not. - What's going on. Alan, I have always conducted my s*x lif. according to three simple principles. One: If at all possible, ladies first. Two: It's easier to be forgive. than ask permission. And third and most important. The 10 seconds it take. to put on a condom... ...beats the hell out of the 10 year. you have to pretend to like soccer. Except when they don't work. Stupid tiny disclaime. on the side of the box. They should put it in big letter. right on the reservoir tip. "Do you feel lucky, dumb-ass?. Yeah, that'd do it. So, uh, what's your next move. Well, you'd think if Chrissy had my chil. and decided not to tell me... ...I'd just send her a little card: "Thanks fo. being a good sport," or something. I'm not sure Hallmar. has a "deadbeat dad" section. It doesn't matter. For some reason. I wanna know the truth. If I have a kid, I need to know about it. Of course you do. Being a fathe. is the greatest joy there is. Hey, Dad, where's the plunger. - Uh, laundry room. - Thanks. I over-wiped. No such thing, my son. - Where was I. - The joys of fatherhood. Right. What? There was a tim. when he didn't wipe at all. Hey, I'm gonna need a mop too. Excuse me. Father-son moment. Daddy's home. Hurry, hurry. - Hey, Jake. - Don't worry, it's all cleaned up. - Not why I'm here. L... - You can hardly smell it at all anymore. Don't kid yourself. Although, I may owe you a toilet. I'll put it on your tab. Now, I wanna ask you a question. Crumb cake, a Frappuccin. and a burrito supreme. That's not the question. Oh, yeah, and a tangerine. That's what killed me. Are you done. I hope so, because the toile. won't flush anymore. What I wanted to ask you is. do you think I've been a good role model. Are you kidding? You drink, you gamble. You have different women her. practically every night. You're the best role mode. a guy could want. - You think so. - Yeah. They should put your face on money. Well, thanks, buddy. I appreciate it. Oh, hey, one more question. . . . . - How would you feel about having a cousin. - I've got a cousin. - I mean, another cousin. - What do I need another cousin for. Ahh, forget it. What I need is a Smartphon. and a new toilet. Cousin. - Charlie. - Hi. What are you doing here. Well, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd stop by and say hello... ...and bring you this. - A Wiffle-ball bat. - That's for Chuck. I got you an eyeglass repair ki. and some malted milk balls. - Thanks. - I know it's not much of a gift. But the guy that usually sells roses a. the freeway on-ramp switched to oranges... ...and I didn't know if you liked oranges. So, anyway, is Chuck my kid. - What difference does it make. - All the difference. - How. - Well, for starters... ...I'm gonna write a scathing lette. to a certain manufacturer of latex products. But more importantly. if I'm his dad, he should know. He's already got a dad. - Oh, really. - Yes. We may not live together anymore. and he may not have your kind of money... ...but he's a good dad. and he loves Chuck very much. So you're just raising him on your own. Charlie, you don't have to worr. about him. He's gotten along fine without yo. for eight years, and so have I. Wait, Chrissy... I didn't know. Boy, you miss one health class... - So, Jake, how do you like high school. - I'm in eighth grade. Oh, I see. When do you start high school. Hard to say. Eighth grade's really kicking my ass. - Jake, language. - Yeah, language, math. - Science, history, phys ed. - Yeah, I understand, dear. Can't even find my locker. All right, I talked to her. You owe me 5 bucks. He's a good wiper, and I love him. Hey, Alan, I just spoke... Aw, jeez. Good to see you too, dear. - What's going on, Mom. - Nothing. I merely stop in to see my two son. and my one and only grandchild. Well, it's... So, Mom, you're looking good. Did you have something snippe. or tucked or sucked. Just eyes and tush. but nice of you to notice. Hey, Charlie, did you ever find ou. if that kid is yours. - Thanks a lot, Berta. - Oh, dear, have I spoken out of turn. - Kid. - Yeah. Well, it... It turns out that there are flaw. in every manufacturing process... ...and that include. your everyday latex products. I see. And how far alon. is the young lady. Oh, about eight years. Eight years. and she's just suing you now. She's not suing me. She doesn't wann. have anything to do with me. Lucky you. If I were her. I'd have owned half this house... ...before the pee stick dried. Yeah, real lucky. I've got an 8-year-old son. and I'll never get to spend time with him. Oh, sweetheart, take it from me... ...spending time with one's childre. is greatly overrated. Oh, come on, face facts. Some people are meant to be parents. and some people aren't. You have a perfect example of tha. right in front of you. You certainly do. Yeah, well, I think I'd be a great dad. Well, easy for you to sa. now that you've dodged the bullet. You're right, talk is cheap. Remind me to speak to hi. about putting this house in my name... ...so it can never fall into the hand. of some money-hungry, manipulative bitch. That isn't related to him. What do you want now, Charlie. Look, I can see why you might no. think of me as father material. And clearly you've done a great jo. raising Chuck on your own. I'd just like, if you'd let me. to help out a little bit. Oh. - This is more than a little bit. - Hey, eight years is a long time. What do you want out of this. I just wanna kno. that he's taken care of. And I plan on sending you a chec. every month. I don't know what to say. You don't have to worr. about me interfering. Although, there's a couple thing. you should know for when he gets older. Like what. Well, you're gonna wanna loc. the liquor cabinet. But don't forget that mouthwas. can also pack a pretty good buzz. So be on guar. for suspiciously minty breath. Oh, and if his school nurs. is at all attractive... ...you can expect the occasional "hernia. . - Thanks for the heads-up. - You're welcome. So, uh... ...good luck. You're gonna need it. Oh, hey. Jeremy, your mom's here. - Hey, Mom. - Hi, honey. - Hey, where'd you get that shirt. - Oh, I got it for him. I hope that's okay. I love it. He looks like a little ladies' man. So, uh, is this tim. next week okay for you. Actually, I think my babysitting day. are behind me. Ciao. I'm really gla. you're accepting responsibility, Charlie. - Thank you. - It's a great feeling... ...knowing you're taking car. of your own kid. - Oh, hey, Mr. Harper. - Hey, Clive. How's it going. Great. All right, Mrs. Melnick. that should hold you for a while. - Hey, dude. - Hey, dude. Thanks, Clive. You're the best. Come on in, honey. - Thanks, Alan. - Bye, buddy. Who was that guy. Oh, that's Clive, the exterminator. He's been coming here forever. - Oh, hey, Alan. - Hmm. - Has it ever occurred to you.... - Hey, Mr. Harper. Hey, Craig. Has what ever occurred to me. Nothing. Hey, Mr. H. Long time no see

episode&$Episode-04-The Flavin' and the MavinjÛrEditor: Jk2writ. [CHUCKLES. I really appreciate you getting up so earl. and driving me to work. I owe you one. Heh. You owed me on. when I didn't smother you in your crib. [CHUCKLES. Well, then I owe you two. Ha, ha. My car will be out of the sho. in a couple of days. There was a... A terrible knock in the engine. Like a. [CLICKING. [CHUCKLES. I kept saying, "Come in," but nobody did. Ha-ha-ha. Ooh, carpool lane. That's us. We should... - Shut up. - Right. [SIGHS. It's 7:00. Where are all these damn people going. Ha, I know, right. I deal with that every day. It's very frustrating. Sometimes I drea. about buying a cabin in the woods and... - I said shut up. - Yes, you did. [SIGHS. People going that way should switch job. with the people going this way... ...and everybody can leav. their freaking cars in the garage. [CHUCKLES. You know, that's a... That's a hell of an idea. Right on. Ha, ha. - Don't patronize me. - Sorry. Wait a minute. How are you getting back to Malibu. - Uh, I was... Uh, I was hoping... Charlie. - No. - Take the bus. - There's no bus from Tarzana to Malibu. Then take a series of busses. And don't get stuc. on having to end up in Malibu. Ugh, Charlie... Come on. It's just for a couple of days. That's what Mom said when she brough. you home from the hospital. [CHUCKLES. Good one. You're a very funny man, Ollie. You certainly are. It's... Laurel and Hardy. Boy, they used to... They used to get in some wacky jams, huh. [CHUCKLES. Oh, what about, uh, Abbott and Costello. [AS COSTELLO. Hey, Abbott. [LAUGHS. Or, uh... Or, uh, Martin and Lewis. You know... [AS LEWIS. Hey, lady. With the flavin and the mavin. and the wow. Three Stooges? Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [CHUCKLES. ALAN. Whoa, why are we stopping. Ow, ow, ow. Oh, a wise guy. Ow. Okay, I don't mind the good-nature. brotherly punching... ...but you did not hav. to twist my nipples. You're lucky I didn't rip them of. and feed them to you. Um, if you have to go to the bathroom. there's one down the hallway. - What's wrong with the one in your office. - Uh, it's not for guests. Neither is my house. Um, I think we're out of paper towels. I'll wipe my hands on you. Get out of the way. [ALAN SIGHS. Morning, Dr. Harper. Morning, Melissa. Hello, Melissa. You rat b*st*rd. The bathroom is down the hallwa. on the right. Good to know. Hi. I'm Charlie, Alan's brother. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Thought you had to tinkle. - Go away. So how long have you been workin. for my baby brother. About six months. Wow. He's been keeping you a secre. for six months. Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute. There's no reason to thank m. for the ride again, Alan. Mi Mercedes, su Mercedes. It's what brothers do when on. is vastly more fortunate than the other. Seriously, we need to talk. Excuse us. - She is the best receptionist I've ever had. - I'm hoping to say the same. God, Charlie, please do not cra. where I work. Hey, you crap where I live. - So tell me about her. - Oh, there's nothing to tell. She's, uh... She's a terrific employee. She does my scheduling, my books. My patients love her. She keep. the operation running like clockwork... ...and she does it al. for crappy pay and no benefits. So you're not hitting that. No, I'm not hitting that. And even if I were hitting that. I wouldn't use the phrase "hitting that.. It's a violent image for a beautiful act. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the coast is clear. No, the coast is not clear. The coast is foggy and strew. with dangerously pointy rocks. Can I get either of you a cup of coffee. - No. - Sure. No for both of us. Please leave. All right. - Bye, Melissa. - Bye, Charlie. Hope I see you again. Oh, you'll see me tonigh. when I come back to pick up your boss. Oh. Oh, no, Charlie. You don't have to mak. that long drive. I'll take the bus. - I thought there were no busses. - Lf I have to, I'll charter one. Why don't I just give you a ride home. Oh, that is so sweet of you. You got a real gem here, Alan. Tell you what. when you get him home... ...there'll be a cold margarit. waiting for you out on my deck. Which overlooks the ocean. On the beach. In Malibu. That sounds wonderful. It's really not. It's chilly, dam. and covered with pelican poop. That's why he'll never wi. the Malibu-slogan contest. Ha, ha! Ahem. - See you tonight, Melissa. - Bye, Charlie. - Have a great day, bro. - I hate you. I hate you too. Gee, your brother is really cute. As a bug. - Bathroom. - Oh, let me give you the key. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. You are a doll. You are cute. She's actually a doll. I wonder if she's anatomically correct. [MELISSA LAUGHING. [SIGHS. Who's the Smurf. The Smurf is my receptionist. You're letting Charlie hit that. Okay, first of all. that is a very ugly phrase. And second, I'm not letting him. Short of drugging him and dumpin. him in the woods, what can I do. Yeah. He is like an Alabama bloodhoun. once he gets a whiff. [CHUCKLES. [MELISSA LAUGHING. Now it's just a matter of waitin. till it blows up in my face. And after it blows up in my face, it wil. then circle around and bite me in the ass. That's me. No face, no ass. Well, that's what you ge. when you mix work and personal. Which is why me and Charlie have alway. kept everything strictly professional. Yeah. Yeah, I've often wondered about that. When I first started work here. I laid down the law: Lookie, no touchy. Yipes. All right. I'll make you another. but you gotta promise not to chug this one. Promise. What a fun gal. Do you know how hard it i. to find a decent receptionist. Well, kudos, bro. You did a great job. Thank you. And I really don't wanna lose her. - Why would you lose her. - Oh, gee, I don't know. Maybe because my brother intends to defil. and discard her like a warm melon. A warm melon. Nothing. Anyway, my point is... ...uh, you're gonna leave her with memorie. that can only be erased... ...by removing herself from anythin. that reminds her of you. Like me. - Is that what you're worried about, Bunky. - Yes, that's what I'm worried about. What did you think. What else would I be worried about. Well, let's see. Your receding hairline. your semiliterate son... ...your budding man boobs. but that's just off the top of my head. - Charlie, please, l... I am begging you... - Look, I understand your concerns. It's not like that. I think Melissa is terrific. Oh, you always think they're terrific. They're terrific before, they're terrific during. It's the after when the cryin. and quitting start. Why is it always about you. Aren't I entitled to some happiness. You've had your share of happiness. You've had your share of happiness. my share, everybody's share. You've sucked the marrow of happines. from the bones of... Oh, just leave her alone, won't you. Alan, you don't have to worry. You're thinking about the old Charlie. The old hump them and dump them. one-track-mind Charlie. Oh. Oh, right. The old Charli. from way back this morning. I'm serious. I honestly wanna star. building a relationship. - Really. - Yeah. Get to know someone. Let her get to know me, have somethin. in common before we jump into bed. - Wow. I'm impressed. - That I'm growing up. No, that you can so easily lie to my face. You'll see. It's gonna be different with Melissa. I'm gonna take my time. form a friendship... ...bond emotionally and then, and only then. take it to the next level. [BED SQUEAKING. MELISSA. Oh, Charlie. You schmuck. Morning, Dr. Harper. Morning. I like your jammies. Thank you. I, uh... I like your... Thank you. Guess you're kind of surprise. to see me, huh. Yeah, shocked. Well, I hope you kno. it is not the kind of thing I usually do. You know, hop into be. with a fella zippity quick. - It's really none of my business. - Well, I don't. But Charlie is so sweet and special. Yep, he's a treasure. Yeah, and this works out well for you. Really? Uh, how do you figure. Since your car's still in the shop. we can carpool to and from work. I see. So you'll be coming back. Oh, yeah. Charlie asked me to stay the weekend. - No kidding. - Yeppers. We really made a connection. And it is not just physical. Although the physical part is amazing. Again, none of my business. It is like I have known him all my life. I know the feeling. You get over it. Hey, baby. Hey, yourself. Mm. Do I smell toast. You do. Would you like a slice. I can put butter and jelly on it. Oh, d?j? vu. MELISSA. Ah! Stop it! Terrible. Whoo. [MELISSA CLEARS THRO AT. Sorry, Dr. Harper. That's okay. I wasn't even listening. I'm gonna take a shower. Hit the road in about 20 minutes. - I thought you were gonna call in sick. - Shush. He's kidding. It's... It's okay. Twenty minutes is fine. Great. [SIGHS. Alan, you know me as a cynical man... ...but in just one night, that little pixi. has melted this cold, lonely heart. You don't say. You may not believe me. but there is something going on here. I really wanna thank yo. for bringing her into my life. I may not believe you. You know what? Fine. Think what you want. Now, if you'll excuse me... ...l'm gonna go play Paul Bunya. Takes a Shower in Tiny Town. Sorry we're running late. That's all right. Shower laste. a bit longer than I planned. Yeah, well, uh, that happens. . . . . I gotta tell you. I am just crazy about your brother. Swell. Hope it works out. And how is a guy like that still single. Well, uh, he's always been a bi. of a butterfly, you know. Fluttering through life, hard to pin down. And being a fall-down drunk is kind o. a speed bump for some of the ladies. [GIGGLES. Such a jokester, Dr. Harper. [ALAN CHUCKLES. Either that or put a gun in my mouth. Oh, listen. On the way home. we have to swing by my apartment... ...so I can get some clothe. for the weekend. ALAN. Mm-hm. And I'm gonna need a little extra tim. for lunch today. Wanna buy some sexy lingerie, heh... ...for, you know. I do. Can I pick you up anything. Yeah, yeah, um, ear plugs would be nice. And that gun I mentioned. Nothing special. I'm only gonna use it just the once. [DOORBELL RINGS. - Hey, Jake. - Hey. Gotta hit the crapper. You must be Judith. I'm sorry, do I know you. I'm Melissa, Dr. Harper's receptionist. We talk on the phone all the time. Oh, right, Melissa. It's nice to finally meet you. Alan. Oh. Oh, hey. Hey. Hi, uh, hi, Judith. This is Melissa. Melissa, Judith. It's not what it looks like. Charlie's doing her, not me. - And, uh, where is Charlie anyway. - Taking a nap. ALAN: Hmm. - He says I drain him. Isn't that adorable. Adorable, disturbing, whatever. Uh, thanks, I've got this. Your brother and your receptionist. What? The Volvo's in the shop. He twisted my nipples... ...and peed in my office. - What. I'm not thrilled, but what can I do. You could think about the effec. these shenanigans have on your son. Okay, you know what, Judith. I have enough problems. If you're not comfortable leaving Jake her. for the weekend, then take him home. Nice try, Alan. You think Uncle Charlie and Meliss. are coming down for lunch. I doubt it. - Can I have their chicken. - Knock yourself out. You know how you sa. I can ask you anything. - Yeah. - Is them being together weird for you. No, no. Well, you're a better man than I. - How so. - Well, remember when Uncle Charlie... ...was hitting my fifth-grade teacher. - Okay. Can we please stop calling it "hitting". I got another word. but I don't think you're gonna like it. Fine. Fine, then I do remember whe. he was hitting your fifth-grade teacher. - That kind of bugged me. - Well, I'm sorry. - Don't think there should be boundaries. - I do think that. But I thought you said it's not weir. he's hitting your receptionist. Ah, uh, well, pal, um, the thing is, um... ...Daddy lied. - Oh, then it is weird for you. - Yes, yes, it's weird for me. - Are you jealous. - Uh, no, no. Because I was a little bit jealou. about Miss Pasternak. She had a rocking bod. [ALAN SIGHS. Eat your chicken. Melissa. We, uh, need to get a move on. A lot of traffic, what with the rain and all. CHARLIE: We need a minute, Alan. - Oh, God. What can they do in a minut. that they didn't do all weekend. MELISSA. You are just a selfish son of a bitch... ...and you can go right to hell. [SOBBING. Sorry, Dr. Harper. I'll be in the car. Well, that could've gone better. I knew it. I thought it might take longe. than 48 hours, but I knew it. Hey, hey, hey. A little sensitivity would be appreciated. I'm hurting here. I'm sure a lot of that is friction burn. - Whoa, whoa, where does that come from. - Oh, where does it come from. It comes from a long histor. of you using my life as a specimen cup. Excuse me. but you're still talking about the old Charlie. This Charlie was hoping to hav. a relationship of substance and depth. By locking a stranger in your roo. and hitting it for two days straight. Okay, mea culpa. Change is hard. And now that I'm hearing it. I agree with you. "Hitting it" is an ugly term. - Don't change the subject. What happened. CHARLIE: Nothing. [CHARLIE GARGLES. I just said to he. maybe we should slow things down... ...see other people. What...? You said this after the two days. How could I know beforehand. I thought you'd be happy. You didn't wan. me to go out with her in the first place. Yes, but it's no longer the first place. It's the last place. What can I tell you, Alan. I made a mistake. I rushed to love. No, no. Your mistake was you rushed to lov. my receptionist. The woman I depend upo. to run my business. Oh, she's a good kid. She'll get over it. [CAR HONKING. You hear that? Does that soun. like a woman who's getting over it. Well, Alan, the wounds are fresh. - You're gonna need to be patient. - Why should I have to be patient. Well, you have to work with her. [CAR HONKING. And it sounds like you better get going. Sure you don't wanna come bac. to my office and hump my fax machine. Wow. You still have a fax machine. You're despicable. - Alan, wait. - What. - Let me make it up to you. - How could you make it up to me. Well, I'm guessing she won't be incline. to bring you back here tonight... ...so why don't you take a ca. and I'll pay for it. Thanks. That makes up for everything. I'm talking cab, not town car. Oh, man. [SIGHS. Breakups are so hard. Ow. Huh. I do have a little friction burn. That miserable son of a bitch. You might wanna extend your brake zon. on the wet roads. It's a little... - I'm so stupid. - No, no, no. You're not stupid. You're a dear, sweet, remarkably bright... Truck. Watch out for the truck. Watch out for the truck. [SHRIEKING. - I want a raise. - Sure, sure. - And health insurance. - A given. Can't believe you don't have it. - And a paid vacation. - Hang on a second. There's only... Aah! Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks

episode$"Episode-03-Damn You, Eggs BenedictjëcEditor: Jk2writ. What are you doing. What does it look like I'm doing. I'd rather not say. I'm trying to open these cinnamon buns. - Why. - I thought I'd try and do a little baking. Ah. You drunk. - Little bit. - Mm. Why is it childproof. Are kids OD'ing on this stuff. Have you considere. reading the instructions. Ooh, listen to Mr. College Boy. "To open. strike sharply on edge of counter.. - Really. - Really. All right, I'll play along. I christen thee HMS Kitchen Table. Godspeed. I think we got a bad bun tube. Give me. Just gotta know how to whack it. I bow to your superior expertise. - So how come you're all spiffed up. - I've got a date. Oh, two nights in a row. So who's the glutton for punishment. At the risk of tooting my own horn. I am actually seeing two different women. - Wow, two women. - Yeah. And yet you're still tootin. your own horn. You know what's fun. When you can talk them into tootin. each other's horns. - I'm not seeing them at the same time. - Well, that makes it more difficult. But not impossible. You put the icing o. after it comes out of the oven, right. Right. Drizzle, don't squeeze. Thus spake the whacker. So, what prompted this brea. from serial monogamy. I just got tired of putting all my egg. in one basket. - The basket being a woman. - Yes. And the eggs being your bun tube. No. See, the thing is, when I'm just datin. one woman at a time... - ...if she dumps me. - When she dumps you. Either way, I have to start from scratc. finding a new woman. However, when I'm dating two women. if one of them dumps me. When one of them dumps you. Either way, I'm not alone. Wait a second. Wait a second. You're sayin. that it's advantageous to date... ...more than one woman at a time. Good lord, man, you're a genius. Yeah, ha, ha. We must tell other men. - Okay, maybe I'm a little late to the party. - A little late. The girl already jumped out of the cak. and everybody's had a piece. Well, late or not, I'm here. When it come. to 40-year-old divorced moms... ...in the San Fernando Valley. I'm quite the catch. - I'm not surprised. - You're not. Lights out at fat camp. a jellybean is steak tartare. Hey, I'm- I'm single, employed. disease-free, well-read, cute as a bug... ...and perfectly capable of pretendin. to like other people's children. Impressive. Did these broads know... ...that you're dipping your chi. in the salsa and the guacamole. - What. - You know. Hitting two piÃ±atas with one stick. Topping off both tank. with the same hose. Throwing your balls down two alleys. Still don't get it. No, I got it, and, uh- And thank you, um. but, no, they don't know. These are divorced moms trolling fo. a new schmuck to replace the old schmuck. And you let them thin. that might be you. It's not like I have to lie. Look at me, I scream schmuckdom. They're rising. It's a miracle. Yes, the miracle of yeast. I gotta go. Go, my son. Drizzle thy frosting on the divorce. sticky buns of the valley. You're a great cook, Uncle Charlie. It's no big deal. Those chefs on TV act lik. they're curing leprosy or something. Can you make meatloaf. Does it come in a tube. No. God, it comes on a plate. Can I have some of that. - Beer? No. - Why not. Because when you're 14. you don't ask your uncle for beer. Who do I ask. I don't know. Uh, try hanging outside a liquor store... ...and look for a guy wearing house slipper. and talking to himself. What's his name. You can't have any beer, Jake. Man, I thought you were cool. I am. And you know what makes me cool. The fact that your opinio. means less than squat to me. How old were yo. when you had your first beer. Thirteen- Two. Thirty-two. - Yeah, right. - Listen, we're talking about you. - What about me. - Well, it's like this. Alcohol is for peopl. who can afford to lose a few brain cells. Yeah, so. I rest my case. What case. Morning, buddy. How do you like your eggs. In an Easter basket. Scrambled it is. - Morning. - Morning. - What you doing. - Cooking breakfast. - How do you like your eggs. - Sunny side up. Scrambled it is. " Cooking for Dummies ". No offense, Jake. I'm actually cooking for everybody. What brought this on. I don't know. I thought I'd expand my horizons a bit. Uh-huh. - What. - I'm just trying to figure out... ...how scrambled egg. are gonna get you laid. - You and me both. - Ha. I got it. Hello. Oh. Oh, hi, Stephanie. Yeah, yeah, I, uh. I had a great time too. Yes, it was special. Uh, I don't usually do tha. on a first date either. Thank you for letting me do that. by the way. - Uh, uh, tonight? Uh, oh, gee. Uh. CHARLIE: Hey, Alan. - How do you like your eggs. - Uh, uh, one sec. Um, Stephanie wants to se. me tonight, but I made a date with Katie. Scrambled it is. Um... Uh, uh, the thing is. uh, I already made plans... ...uh, with my, uh, you know, son. who I love dearly. - What are we doing. - Nothing. Go away. Oh, oh, what are we doing. Uh, uh, well, he and I have this, uh. this father-son thing... ...uh, where, once a week, we, uh. - Rent go-karts. - Rent go-karts, and, uh- And, uh. - Eat pizza. - And eat pizza. And, uh- And. - And drink beer. - And drink. Go away. Uh, and drink, uh, a lot of water... ...which the body needs to, uh. to stay healthy. Um, anyway. we're on for Saturday, right. Oh, okay. Uh, uh, great, great. Good. I'll see you then. Okay, bye. - We're not going go-karting, are we. - No. You're using m. for your own purposes, aren't you. Here's $20. Hey, Alan, taste these. Why does it smell like bourbon. The book said, "Season to taste.. Just kidding, I spilled. No, thank you. Suit yourself. CHARLIE. Hmm. A little too much egg. Jake, let's go. I told your mothe. I'd have you back by 7. Hey, Alan, Alan, Alan. Would you tast. my hollandaise sauce. - You made hollandaise sauce. - You tell me. You did not make hollandaise sauce. Damn you, eggs Benedict. Charlie, why are you doing this. - Doing what. - In the six years I have been here... ...the only time I've seen yo. turn on the stove was to light a cigar. Yeah, well, people grow, people change. People get drun. while watching the Food Network. Jake, let's go. Uh, I may not be back till late. Uh, I'm planning on giving my ros. to Bachelorette Number 2. Wow. Only you could gay u. banging two women. Says the man in the apro. with the curdled hollandaise sauce. So you admit it is hollandaise sauce. Drop me off at Gabe's hous. so we can study. - Oh, you're really gonna study. - Sure. Great. See that. He respects me enough to lie to me. Hey, Alan, speaking of lies. At some point, one of these broad. is gonna ask you a question... ...for which you will have no answer. - Like what. - It could be as simple as. "What did you do last night?. Or as tricky as, "Why is there a past. stuck to your testicles?. The point is, you need to be careful. You're gonna teach me to lie to women. Well, do you know enoug. to pull the pasty off... ...and say, "Happy anniversary". I do now. You need to remember. always answer a question... ...with another question. - What do you mean. - Exactly. - What. - Great, you're all set. - Drunk again. - Yep. Well, uh, thank you. - Uh, I appreciate the advice. - I've got more. Uh, Charlie, please don't take thi. the wrong way... ...but if a semi-functioning win. such as yourself... ...can date several women at the same time. I'm quite certain I can handle two. Why would I take that the wrong way. Ugh. Tastes like stale ass. Mm. Oh. Is it just me, or does this thin. we have feel really, really comfortable. - Oh, yeah. - Ha, ha. I mean, you know, maybe no. pet-names-for-our-pee-parts comfortable... ...but, uh, we're certainly getting there. Oh, hey, next week, my ex is takin. my daughter to see his parents... ...so you and I can spen. the whole weekend in bed. That sounds great. I'll leave myself alone till then. Oh, oh, oh. Wait, wait. Uh- Uh, uh, next weekend. Ahh, uh, you know, ah. I'll have to check... ...but I think Saturday is, uh... ...a working Saturday for me. Oh, no, really. Yeah, yeah. It's unfortunate. but in today's economic climate... ...uh, Saturday is no longer the Sabbat. for anybody, except religious Jewish people. . . . . You know, the guys with the beard. and the hats. Uh, did you see Yentl? I love that movie. That's one I wouldn't mind owning. Alan, are you seeing another woman. Charlie, are you seeing another woman. Why would you ask me that. I just need to know I can trust you. Yeah, well, trust is a two-way street. - I know. - Do you. Because without trust. all we have is s*x. Well, you can trust me, Charlie. God, I hope so. I've been hurt before. Aw. Well, I won't hurt you. I promise. Okay, then. - Another woman. - Yeah. Well, uh- Oh, you think I'm involved... - ...with another woman? Heh. - Yeah. You actually thin.

Are you married. Because I really thought I. You know. your body's sending you a message. Yeah, it's saying I should reall. chew my food more. Look at that shrimp. You could wash it off and serve it again. Your body is also telling yo. that alcohol is poison. If it's poison, why do you drink it. Because there are things inside of m. I need to kill. You can't kill bad feelings with alcohol... - ...Uncle Charlie. - Right. And you can't stuff your emotion. with cupcakes. Believe me, I've tried. I'm sure you have. If you ever need to tal. about any of this stuff, I'm here for you. Good to know. Whoa, I felt that one in my nuts. Hello? Anybody home. Are you gonna rat me out.

Deck the halls while sleigh bells ring... take the Christmas or New Years challenge and pick one of your favorite TV Christmas/New Year's episodes, or your all time favorite Christmas movies in our Christmas/New Years section.... wrap up in a cozy blanket this winter with your favorite cup of hot cocoa and edit a holiday script. Which one will you do? Halloween, Thanksgiving or Christmas/New Years? Start by. Copy/Paste and use Notepad++/Word or whatever program you want... watch the show/movie and add names to it, correct/join sentences. Email me back (use the contact link on board) the updated copy to replace on the board. Full credit will be given to you. If you love it, you can sign up to be an Editor of an entire forum and do more, if you hate it... at least you did one to help everyone worldwide have a better reading experience. I mean, why not? We're all watching more TV this year with more time on our hands.. Here is an example of one that was done for the TV show Game of Thrones. https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=774. One that was done for the TV show The Walking Dead. https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=648. And here was one done for the movie Twilight: https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=956&t=914. There are many other examples on the board and as you can see you can do it however you like.. If you would like to help edit any of our transcripts at any time with character names, locations or just fix spacing or sentence structure please contact me via our contact page at the bottom of this site or our facebook page IM. You are welcomed to send us updated transcripts for us to replace on this site or if you want to be a board Editor of an entire forum - just register on this site (using the drop down menu at the upper left corner of the site) and send us your username and which forum you'd like to edit- we'll set you up! No experience needed to volunteer! Serious inquires only. ****Lastly, If this site is ever down or experiencing problems you can read current status updates on our facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/foreverdreaming.org/ Please, try not to overwhelm us by sending emails as that takes away time from us trying to fix any issues.  Thank you for your support and understanding!. Thank you to so many of you for your generous donations in helping with the costs and volunteering editing help in the last year... especially during such a difficult pandemic

showTwo-And-Half-Menj¼mEditor: Jk2writ. Oh, this is going to be so great. Are you guys as excited as I am. Probably not. Okay. âª Happy... âª ... birthday to yo. âª Happy Birthday to yo. âª Happy Birthday, dear Rose . âª Happy Birthday to you. Oh, you have got to be kidding me. You guys are the best. Is that a chocolate fudge cake. You tell us; you brought it. Shouldn't you, uh, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oh, right, right. I wish this was chocolate fudge. Now, it's time for the party games. I got one. It's called "Drink Until This Night Makes Some Sort of Sense.. I'll go first. Nope, not yet. Round Two... JAKE: Uncle Charlie. Go away. Have you seen my iPod. No. What about you, Rose. No. Sorry, Jake. Oh, man. Good morning, sleepy head. Morning. So, what's new. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men... . Mmm, that's good coffee. Good morning. It's gettin' there. Whose birthday cake. Rose. Oh. Surprise party. No, I think she saw it coming. 'Morning. 'Morning. Hey. Coffee. Can you make it to go. To go. Yeah, the thing is, I made a little... boo-boo. A boo-boo? A boo-boo. Anyway, I may have to leave town for a few days. Why? What'd you do. Rose. What. I-I did Rose. Wait, you had s*x with Rose. Are you insane. Moot point, Alan. What I have to do now is find my passport and head for the border. What you have to do is tell Rose th-th-that I was drunk and I'm sorry and that there's no reason to hunt me down and glue my testicles to my thigh. Again. I'll tell you right now, you're swabbin' on your own nail polish remover this time. That wasn't pleasant for either of us, Berta. What the hell were you thinking. Thinking. There was no thinking. We had a few tequila shots and we were talking, having a nice evening, then somebody suggested a sponge bath. Somebody. It might've been me. Anyway, the next thing I know, Jake is waking us up looking for his iPod. Jake saw you in bed with Rose. No. Oh, great, great. That's just great. What am I gonna tell him. Who cares? He's 11. He'll get over it. I'm the one who still has a bald patch on my scrotum. And let me tell ya, the comb-over isn't foolin' anybody. Morning. Oh. Hey, look, it's Rose. Morning, Rose. BERTA: Hey, birthday girl. Did you get anything good last night. It was a wonderful party. Isn't that nice. Can I get you anything. Coffee? Orange juice? Industrial-strength adhesive. No, I can't stay. I'm having a birthday lunch with my dad. Oh, well, that's great. Not that I'm anxious for you to leave. But it's great that you're gonna spend some time with your dad. Dads are great. I like the word "dad" better than "father.. You know, if Hitler had called Germany the Dadland instead of the Fatherland, I bet it would've been a much friendlier country. Charlie. Yes. You're acting crazy. Am I. Hey, if anybody knows... I understand last night was just one of those things. I have no expectations. Okay. Good. And.... And nothing. I'll see ya later. Bye, guys. Bye. Oh, God, it's worse than I thought. What are you talking about. She sounded perfectly fine with everything. Berta, tell him. She's nuts. He's screwed. âª Men... Uncle Charlie? Yeah, buddy. You know what'd be cool? If you and Rose got married. Yeah, Charlie, that would be cool. I could be the best man. Carry the ring for you and the medication for her. Do pharmacies have bridal registries. Hey, have you guys talked about having kids. Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter of teeny-weeny crazy-ass feet. No. He's not gonna marry Rose. Why not? He's already getting s*x from her. Jake, Jake... the only reason Rose was in my bed is because she was too tired to go home. Uncle Charlie, I'm an underachiever, not an idiot. Okay, fine. You want the truth. Charlie, please be discreet. Just because a man and woman have s*x doesn't mean they have to get married. It doesn't mean they have to see each other again. It doesn't even mean they have to give their actual names. Thank you for your discretion. No, no, no. It's time somebody taught him the facts of life. What facts? That you did a stupid, stupid thin. 'cause you're a stupid, stupid man. I was getting to that. Why was it stupid. Because he had s*x with someone he doesn't love. No, no, because I had s*x with someone who knows how to disable the alarm system. And who has no compunction about shaving my head while I sleep. What's a compunction. Go get ready for bed. Sounds dirty. Just go. [IN DEEP VOICE]: Hey, lady, I can see your compunction. Charlie, will you do me a favor? What. Don't talk to my kid about s*x. Why. Because you're a pig. Okay. What was that. What was what. It was a thump. What do you mean, a thump. You know, a thump. Like a crazy woman dressed as a ninja jumping from a tree and landing on the roof with cat-like precision. I didn't hear anything. Well, I did. I guess your hearing's more acute when your nuts are on the line. Come on, Charlie, you don't really think Rose is gonna do anything. Hey, I never told you half the weird stuff she pulled around here. Why not. Well, we needed a baby-sitter and I didn't want you to get spooked. Okay, I'm listening. One time, she trained a seagull to swoop down... [KNOCK AT DOOR] Oh, God, this is it. Come on, Charlie. I cannot believe a grown man like you is afraid of a little girl. A little girl with a big seagull. Went right for my eyes. You ever seen one of 'em swoop down on a picnic table to grab a french fry. It was just like that. Charlie... I'll bet that's how she trained it. Took a picture of me and put french fries all over it. You're being ridiculous. [KNOCK AT DOOR. Am I. We'll see. Are you Charlie Harper. Yes, I am. I'm Rose's father. I don't see a way to back out of this, do you. So, you're Rose's dad. I can see the resemblance. You and I need to talk. Well, sure, if you want. I'm booked up for the next few days, but maybe we can pencil something in for next week. Now. Or now. There's a little window in my schedule now. Come on in. Thank you. Can I get you something to drink. I'm fine. Okay, well, then you don't mind if I have a little conversation starter, do you. Knock yourself out. I'm sure gonna try. So, uh, I'm, uh, Charlie's brother, Alan. Nice to meet you. Same here. Uh... I never slept with your daughter. I'm not surprised. Okay, Rose's dad. Call me Harvey. Okay, Harvey. That's easy. Like the big invisible rabbit in that Jimmy Stewart movie. What was that called. Harvey. Right. Duh. Loved that movie. A lot of people don't know it was originally a play, and then after the movie, they tried to make it a musical... Charlie. Yes, sir? Sit down. Yes, sir. Now... what are your intentions towards my daughter. Oh, right to the chase. Straight shooter. I like that. Ah, thirsty. So, where were we. He wants to know what your intentions are towards Rose. Thank you. Well, I-I would have to say that my intentions are good. In fact, anybody who knows me would confirm that Charlie Harper has good intentions. His actions, on the other hand, are usually selfish and asinine. Again, thank you. Okay, Harvey, well, I'm glad we had this chance to talk... Sit down. Sorry. So, are you going to marry my daughter or not. Not. Not. A very well-intended not. So, after two years together, you just plan to keep on stringing her along. No, I would never... Wait a minute, did you say two years. Now, look, Rose cares very much about you, and she's not going to leave you. So I think the honorable thing for you to do is to let her go. Believe me, Harvey, I've tried. God, how I've tried. What's the problem. You love her too much. Not exactly. I mean, she is a wonderful gal, and I do care for her, but... you see... What, the peanut gallery taking a break. Harvey, the truth is, Charlie has tried to end it, but your daughter doesn't handle rejection all that well. Or all that legally. And in my defense, we're not talking about a long-term relationship. We're talking about a couple of nights of drunken, frenzied s*x two years apart. That's your defense. I didn't say it was a good defense. You'll have to forgive my brother. He thinks with his pen1s, and his pen1s isn't very bright. That's true. Anybody who knows me will confirm that. [KNOCK AT DOOR. I can confirm that. Oh, for God's sake. Rose, did you tell your father we've been going out for two years. Well, yeah. I thought it sounded better than saying we had a one-night stand, and then I stalked you for two years. She's not wrong. Daddy... try to understand. I didn't want you feel sorry for me, or try to set me up with anybody... or have me committed. Oh, sweetheart, I would never do that. We're a wealthy family. We can afford home care. Okay. Well, I'm glad we had this chance to clear the air. I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about, so I'll let you get to it. Mom. Hang on, dear. [PHONE RINGING. Hello. Alan. Oh, good, I'm glad you're home. Listen, uh, I'm in the neighborhood, and I know how Charlie hates it when I just drop in unannounced, so I thought I'd call first. I'll let him know. Charlie, Mom's coming over. Tell her I'm not here. Hi, sweetie. Oh, hello, Rose. Hi, Evelyn. Daddy, this is Charlie's mom, Evelyn. Evelyn, this is my father, Harvey. Harvey, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So what are we talking about. Well, Charlie and I got hammered last night, and then somebody suggested a sponge bath... It might've been me. And then we ended up spending the night together. I see. Are you as proud of yours as I am of mine. Well, you know, you do the best you can to raise them, but, in the end, they drive down life's highway on their own. Isn't that the truth. I think God gives us children so death won't come as such a disappointment. . . . . So, Evelyn... are you married. Not at the moment. Why. What'd you have in mind. Well, maybe we could start with a little dinner. Sounds good. But how do you want to finish. Simultaneously. Oh, he's good. âª Men... [PHONE RINGS. Hello. Oh, hi, Mom. Hold on. Alan. Yeah? Get the door. Boys, we have a problem. We need to talk. What's going on. We haven't seen you in a couple of days. Not that we're complaining. Merely an observation. Well, as you know, I have been seeing Rose's father. Uh-huh. And how's that going. [SIGHS]: At first it was wonderful. He was handsome, charming, and a raging bull in the sack. No mental pictures. Push 'em out. Don't give them to me. But what I didn't realize is the man has the emotional stability of a bag of rats in a burning meth lab. What'd he do. It's what he didn't do. Okay, what didn't he do. Leave. A couple of days of Viagra-enhanced boinking, and he suddenly thinks he lives with me. He's moving my furniture around. He's getting his mail forwarded. He had a satellite dish installed. Did he get the NFL package. Charlie, please, this is not funny. This man is obsessed with me. He will not let me out of his sight. Wherever I go, there he is with a stupid, love-smitten look on his face. You just want to hit him with a shovel. Well, what do you want us to do. Come over to my house and hit him with a shovel. Wouldn't it be easier to keep feeding him Viagra until he strokes out. Charlie, don't be ridiculous. That could take months. Come on, now, guys, think. How can I get this loon out of my house. I say we bring in some expert help. Way ahead of you... Rose. Yes, Charlie. Road trip. Oh, goody, I'll meet you in the garage. [WHISTLE BLOWING ON TV. [SIGHS. Daddy. Oh, Rose, good, you got my change of address card. And there's my other favorite gal. Hello, Harvey. Where were you, puddin' pop. I was worried sick. I just went out. I didn't see you leave. That's because I climbed out the laundry room window. Oh, aren't you a limber little minx. Daddy, we need to talk. Yes, right away, honey. Hey, fellas. Are you ready for some football. Evie, why don't you get our guests some cold drinks. Yes, of course, dear. Garden shed, shovel, bag of lime. Daddy, listen to me very closely. Okay. You don't live here. Yes, I do. Look at me. We've been through this before, remember. The pretty receptionist at your psychiatrist's office. Oh, yeah. Cheryl. She had a mean lawyer. Well, this is different. Evelyn and I are in love, and we're gonna get married. Isn't that right, puddin' pop. Not if you were the last crazy man on earth. Guys, feel free to call me "Dad.. No, thank you. I couldn't. Daddy, pay attention. Okay. I know what it feels like to be so in love with someone you want to crawl inside them so that you're wearing their skin like a leotard with nipples. But what I've learned is that not everyone is ready for that kind of intimacy. Take me and Charlie, for example. We slept together two years ago, realized how much better we were as friends, and we haven't done it again since. We haven't. You were too drunk. I was gonna tell you eventually. Why'd you let me think we did. Because it doesn't make any difference. I'm in this for the long haul. You know, sweetheart, when Evie and I get married, Charlie will be your stepbrother. Oh, I didn't think of that. Ooh, tres kinky. Rose, stick with the plan. Okay. I didn't want to have to do this, but I brought someone else here to talk to you. Who. Come on in, Grandma. You brought Mother. HARVEY'S MOTHER: Harvey. How many times have I told you not to leave the estate without telling me. Aw, Mom. Playtime's over. Get in the car, we're going home. But, Mom, we're getting married. To this trash. I don't think so. Excuse me. Roll with it, Mom. I'm counting to three, Harvey. One, two... I'm going, I'm going. Keep the robe. Thanks, I'm not wearing pants. Harvey! Do you want me to put you over my knee. All right, I'm going. He's really a good boy. But these things happen when you marry a first cousin. I say they're lucky to have thumbs. âª Men... I'm really sorry to impose on you. I just feel very uncomfortable being home alone tonight. No problem, you can sleep in my room. Where will you sleep. I don't know, I'll find somebody. I'm beat. I'm gonna go to bed. Good night. Good night, sweetheart. Good night, Mom. Sleep tight, puddin' pop

episode*(Episode-09-Madame and Her Special FriendjfEditor: Jk2writ. Jake. Yeah. Are you praying. It's okay, I'm not in school. No, no, it's fine. What are you praying for. I have a math test on Monday. Oh, so you're praying for a good grade. No, that never works. I'm praying for the teacher to get sick. Have you considered just studying for the test. How would that help. Okay, listen to me. Even if we were to assume a God who would be willing to give your teacher a cold... Anthrax. All right, that's it, no more praying. What are you, the Supreme Court. How do you know about the Supreme Court and prayer. This guy on TV, Reverend Don, he talks to God. And he said you should pray to strike down your teacher. No, activist judges. But I figured why can't it work on Miss Stanley. And you know what else. If I send Reverend Don money, God will make me rich. And did you send him money. Wouldn't you. No... God doesn't make people rich. And even if He did, it wouldn't make you happy. Well, I disagree. Jake. Reward without effort is meaningless. Money alone will not give you fulfillment. What about Uncle Charlie. He seems pretty fulfilled and he doesn't do anything. Hey, let me tell you about your Uncle Charlie. He puts on a happy face, but on the inside he is a sad, lonely man. [WOMAN GIGGLING. You see. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª âª Oo. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men âª âª Ooh âª Oo. âª Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ah. âª Men. âª Men. I'm about to do a load of laundry. Last chance to change your underwear. I'm good. Oh, uh, but you might want to hold off on the washing machine. I think Charlie and his friend are still in the shower. I'll check. [TOILET FLUSHING. [CHARLIE AND WOMAN SCREAMING. You were right. [DOORBELL RINGS. I wouldn't wait for me to get that. Hello. Hello. Uh, we haven't met. I'm Norma Seabury from next door. Oh, it's nice to finally meet you. I'm Alan Harper. Harper. Are you related to that dreadful Charlie. My mother says I am, but frankly, I have my doubts I'm related to her. I see. Well, Alan, there's a little red sports car blocking my driveway. I assume it belongs to one of your brother's hooers. One of his what. Hooers. Ever since he moved in here, it's been one endless parade of hooers. Oh, whores. Well, in all fairness, most of them don't have the math skills to be whores. Be that as it may, I'm late for my hair appointment, and I want that car moved immediately. Oh, absolutely. I am so sorry. Let me track down the... hooer in question and ask her to move it. Thank you. [SNEEZES. God bless you. He'd better, I sent in five bucks. Charlie, we have a situation. [CHARLIE AND WOMAN GIGGLING. CHARLIE: Okay, that looks pretty clean. Now do me. This is so unfair. [WATER RUNNING. Excuse me. CHARLIE: Not now, Alan, I'm making bubbles. I don't care what her name is, her car is blocking our neighbor's driveway. Oh, sorry, I'll move it. CHARLIE: You can't go now. You're busy. Oh, yeah. I'm busy. All right, just-just tell me where the keys are, and I'll move it. Oh, gosh, no. I don't let strange men touch my car. Oh, good. At least you have respect for your car. Alan, do we need to have another boundaries talk. No, I'm leaving. CHARLIE: Uh-oh, look what's dirty again. WOMAN: Uh-oh. [MIMICS GIGGLING. [TOILET FLUSHING. [SCREAMING. Okay, I have located the owner of the sports car. Is she going to pull it out. Not for a while. Well, how am I supposed to get to my hair appointment. Gee, I'd say you really don't need one. I think your hair looks lovely as it is. Well, aren't you sweet. Are you homosexual. No, just sweet. Listen, you don't have to miss your appointment. I'll drive you. You would do that for me. It would be my pleasure. Sure you're not homosexual. Positive. You would've made a good one. âª Men... CHARLIE: You going home already. Nah, I'm going to the opera. They can't end it until I sing. There's no call for sarcasm. [LAUGHTER. Oh, no. What's up. What is that old witch doing here. Old witch. She's a charming woman. Of course she's charming. They're all charming. That's how they lure you into their houses made out of candy and gingerbread. What exactly is the deal between you two. Why do you hate her so much. Why don't you ask her why she hates me. I did. She told me you're a horrible neighbor who doesn't care about anyone but himself. Well, there you go. How can I like somebody who talks about me like that. Hello, Mr. Harper. Hey, Norma. Eat any little kids lately. I could ask you the same thing. And by the way, will she be moving her car out of my driveway any time soon. Well, maybe people wouldn't park in front of your driveway if you didn't put your trash cans in my guest parking spot. You don't have a guest parking spot. There's no such thing as a guest parking spot. It's called a curb and it belongs to the City of Malibu. Hey, if I can pass out on it, I figure it's mine. Well, with that logic, I... I guess you own my doghouse too. That only happened once and Bruno was fine with it. Alan, thank you so much for a wonderful day. I'm looking forward to next Saturday. Oh, me, too. And as for you, Mr. Harper, Bruno never had fleas before that night. You passed out in her doghouse. Hey, I've passed out in wheelbarrows, but this isn't about me. Oh, really? Who is it about. You. Why are you dating a woman who most likely lost her virginity during World War II. And knowing her, probably not to one of our guys. Okay, first of all, we aren't dating. I am escorting her to a charity event. And second of all, her age is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is what's inside a person. Yeah, well, the only thing inside her is dust and undigested mastodon meat. She isn't that old, Charlie. Oh, come on, I'll bet she was an eyewitness to the birth of agriculture. Stop it. Her high school graduation picture's probably on a cave wall in France. Are you done. Mm... Her prom theme was "Fire.. Charlie, I can't figure out how to turn off the shower. There's so many knobs. That's okay, honey. You just dry off, and I'll take care of it. Thanks. How does it feel to be dating a woman whose IQ is the same as her age. I can ask you the same thing. Oh, here's something else we have in common. Both our girls are pruney, but mine's gonna plump back up in a little while. âª Men... Well, thank you for a lovely evening. Oh, no, thank you for taking me. I so loathe going to these things by myself. And dancing. I can't remember the last time I danced. That was fun. One more spin. Okay, sure. [NORMA HUMMING. [LAUGHING. Oh, thank you for being so kind to a lonely old gal. Stop saying that. You are not old. You're a vibrant, fascinating woman, and I had a great time with you tonight. Oh, likewise. Alan, I want you to give some serious thought to my offer. I will. I will. Okay, so, uh, so good night. Good night. Oh, all right. Morning. Morning. Who sent the flowers. I'll give you a hint. Wait 'til you see the card. You read the card. I couldn't. It's in Aramaic. Okay, I get it. She's old. It was delivered by a Roman centurion. Oh, geez. I've got a problem. Hey, if you got her pregnant, we can get a full page in Ripley's. Give it a rest, Charlie. Oh, come on, I've been working on these all morning. Listen to this. Her first car was a chariot. She called her first husband "hun" 'cause he was one. Her first Christmas was the first Christmas. Likes to take long walks on the beach after crawling out of the ocean and growing legs. Her birthstone is lava. And finally, the Big Bang. I don't have a joke for that yet, but I know there's something there. I'm leaving. Oh, come on, I'm your brother. You can talk to me. Okay, I promise, no more jokes. Tell me what the problem is. Okay. You know she's rich, right. Richer than God. Who she's known since he was yay high. You promised. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. Well, last night, Norma made me a business proposition. A business proposition? I bet it involved... No! No! No. No telegraphs, no flying machines, no Nina, no Pinta, no Santa Maria. You don't have to bite my head off. I was talking about what I do for a living, and she said she wanted to invest... in me. Invest in you? How. She wants to buy a building and create the Alan Harper Healing Center. Uh, chiropractic, acupuncture, uh, holistic pharmacy, aroma therapy... Why don't you just call it the Alan Harper House o' Crap. Norma chose the name. I see. And in exchange for all this, she expects you to... Well, nothing has been said explicitly, but... yeah. And you're considering it. No. No, of course not. Not really. Not really. Well, the building would be in Beverly Hills and it would have my name on the top. Big letters, but, you know, with a real classy font. I'm thinking Helvetica. . . . . Okay, I see your dilemma. We gotta think this through. Thanks, thanks. I really need to. You'd do her for free if she was young and beautiful, right. Well, sure, I suppose. And you'd stick your dingus in a beehive for, say, a hundred million, wouldn't you. A hundred million dollars. Probably. But where are we going with this. Well, we've established that you're a man whore, and now we're just trying to zero in on your price. Charlie, you're not helping at all. Alan, did you really think I would. âª Men. Good to see you again, Ms. Seabury. Thank you, Bobby. My pleasure. Thank you. Good luck. Go away, Bobby. So, Alan... have you given any more thought to my little business proposal. Well, actually, I have and, uh... Oh, wait, I forgot. I brought you a little gifty. Oh, no, Norma, please, you've been too kind already. Oh, my God, a Rolex. It's a platinum Rolex. A platinum Rolex. I have always wanted a platinum Rolex. I almost bought one for myself, but silly me, I got health insurance for my family instead. Let me put it on you. Okay. Ooh. It's a lot heavier than my calculator Swatch. I'm glad you like it. Champagne for madame and her... special friend. Hey, Bobby, look. Very nice, sir. Oh... This is too much. I-I-I-I can't accept this. Oh, I think you can. Yeah, I probably can. A toast. To the Alan Harper Healing Center. Okay. And to us. Uh... to us as business partners and friends, right. Wrong. Oh. Alan. What. I've proposed a toast. Oh, yes. I'm sorry. It's just, this is all happening so fast. Yes, well, the heart wants what the heart wants. The question is, Alan... what do you want. [LOUD TICKING. Hurry up, sugar-buns. I'm not getting any younger. âª Men. Charlie... wake up. What. What's wrong. I had s*x with Norma. What. I gave in. I folded. I let her have her way with me. How was it. Actually, it was great. She... knew stuff. Is that a Rolex. Yeah. Platinum. Nice. And you're gonna get a building in Beverly Hills. Not bad for a night's work. Well, actually, I don't think I'm gonna be getting the building. She reneged. She... died. You're kidding. After we were done, she looked at me, mumbled a couple of words, closed her eyes and then... poof. Dead. That's it. I knew there was a Big Bang joke. I mean, I'm sorry. I just can't believe it. Me neither. After all those years of making me miserable, she's actually gone. It's weird, I feel a little sad. Imagine how I feel. Yeah, you killed her. So what did she mumble before she, you know.... Well, I'm not sure, but I think she said... "I want my watch back.. Hey, I tried my best to keep up with her. Anyway, I've been up half the night with the police and the coroners. You have no idea how judgmental those people are. You can't worry about what anyone else thinks, Alan. The thing you got to remember and keep close to your heart is... I get an extra parking space and you get to keep the watch. Enjoy it, buddy. How can I enjoy it. Same way I enjoy that grand piano downstairs. What does the piano have any.... Wait a minute. Are you saying that you slept with Norma. Hey, I needed a piano. So... so if you slept with Norma, why did she hate you so much. Probably because I only needed one piano. You're right, though. She did know stuff. âª Men. Hey, can you put on channel 84. I want to watch Reverend Don. Well, I want to watch football. It's the Lord's day. Yeah, but it's my TV. Who'd you bet on. Packers, minus one and a half. If the Vikings don't score in the next two minutes, I'm up a grand. Okay. What are you doing. Praying for the Vikings to score. Don't do that. Are you crazy. Change the channel to Reverend Don. No. Then you leave me no choice. Okay, you want to play that way? Fine. It won't work. God answers kids' prayers first. Who told you that. Nobody. It just makes sense. ANNOUNCER: That last drive put the Vikings in field goal range. Oh, God, oh, God... Too little, too late. Here comes the Vikings kicking unit out onto the field. Okay, tell you what. Pray for my side, I'll give you a piece of my winnings. How much? Five percent. No deal. Edinger has yet to miss from this distance. Okay, ten. Twenty. Twenty. And there's the snap... Deal. The kick is up. It's good. Oh, no. Don't blame me. You're a sinner

episode-+Episode-17-The Unfortunate Little SchnauzerjªwEditor: Jk2writ. So, any thoughts on what you'd like for dinner this weekend. You decide, honey. I love everything you cook. Oh, so all of a sudden I'm a woman because I cook and try to make a nice home for you. Okay, I heard it, too. Shut up. JAKE: Gangway. Jake. Leave him alone. With his grades, he might as well get used to pushing shopping carts around. Are you saying my son's going to end up working in a supermarket. No, I'm saying he's probably going to end up homeless. Well, as I live and breathe, Charlie Harper. [SOTTO VOCE]: Oh, great. Archie. So how's the best jingle writer in the business. Looks like he's put on a few pounds. Archie, this is my brother, Alan. Alan, Archie Baldwin, the king of the jingle writers. Well, I don't know about that. More like the ayatollah of the jingle writers. The Grand Pooh-Bah, if you will. Really? What's that make you, Charlie. To be honest, a little nauseous. Hey, listen, we should get together sometime, maybe collaborate. I'd like that. Well, sure, there's no downside for you. What the hell. Remind me about it at the awards dinner. Oh, I'm not going to that. Well, why not? You're nominated. What are you nominated for. It's a silly advertising award. Doesn't mean anything. Yeah, he's right. It's not about the trophies, it's about the work. P.S.: My work has won seven trophies. Hey, one more, I'll have a menorah. Well, good luck, Archie, but I think I'll pass. Oh, well, good for you. Stay home and sulk. Nice meeting you. Okay, where do they keep the extra-large condoms. Boy, he's a piece of work. He's a piece of something. Hey, how come you never mentioned that whole awards thing. It's no big deal. I've been nominated plenty of times. Oh. Well, how many times have you won. What difference does it make. So never. Yes, Alan, never. But that guy Archie has won, like, seven times. Yes, he has. Wow, that's got to sting. Hey, Alan, have you ever been beaten to death with a can of corn. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª âª Oo. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men âª âª Ooh, oo. âª Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ah. âª Men. âª Men. [POP ROCK MUSIC PLAYING. âª Bad stuff grows in the crack of your toes . âª And nobody knows like Toe-Zene . âª Itchy feet burn, make you squiggle and squirm . âª Get fast relief with Toe-Zene . âª Toe-Zene ANNOUNCER: Toe-Zene anti-fungal medication should not be used by pregnant women, people with heart conditions or those who are taking SSI inhibitors. âª Toe-Zene. I don't know. This could be my year. I really think it's your best work, Charlie. Thanks. I know I said the same thing about Mr. Herpes Lip Balm. Yeah. Just Like a Woman Natural Douche. And that hemorrhoid cream. What was it called. Fire in the Hole. That was good, but Toe-Zene is the one that's finally going to bring home the gold. Thanks for your support, Rose. You're welcome. Now, can you do something for me. No. Oh, come on, Charlie. I want you to talk to my boyfriend. Why would I want to talk to your boyfriend. Because he's smothering me, and not in the good, "Can you move your thigh off my face" kind of way. I need my space, Charlie. I wake up in the morning and there he is staring at me. I have a bowl of soup, and there he is blowing on it for me. Even when we have s*x, I can feel his eyes burning a hole in the back of my head. Oh, that's going to keep me up tonight. You have to explain to him that if you love someone, you have to let them go. If they come back, they're yours. If they don't, then you stalk them. Look, I really don't want to get involved in your love life. Well, if someone doesn't talk to him, we're gonna have to break up. Do what you have to do. Oh, I get it. You want me to be single again. Get him over here. Thank you. Was that so hard. âª Men. [PLAYING SOFT VERSION OF TOE-ZENE JINGLE. I had no idea these awards were so prestigious. They're meaningless crap. Come on. Look at this list of past winners for Best Jingle. Barry Manilow, Randy Newman, Kenny Loggins, Archie Baldwin, Archie Baldwin, Archie Baldwin... [BANGS PIANO KEYS. What's your point. My point is it's an honor just to be nominated. No, no, it's an honor to win. Being nominated is just a soul-sucking waste of time. Why are you so sure you're going to lose. Because it doesn't matter who wrote the best jingle. It's about who has the sexiest product. That's why the awards always go to car and beer ads. Over-the-counter medications just aren't hip enough. That hardly seems fair. Tell me about it. Encourage people to get drunk and drive fast, great, here's an award. Relieve the heartbreak of vaginal itching. They don't even want to shake your hand. Well, win or lose, you should still go to the ceremony. No, no, no, no, no. An awards ceremony is like a Thai massage. If you don't know that there's going to be a happy ending, there's no point in lying down. It's not just about you, Charlie. You have a family who's proud of your accomplishments and might like the chance to share them. What family is that. Your family: me, Jake, Mom. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Do not tell Mom about this nomination. Why? It's a good thing. It doesn't matter. If it's a good thing, she'll find a way to make it bad. Okay, now you're just being ridiculous. Oh, really. Let's try a little experiment. I'll pretend I'm Mom and you tell me something good. All right. Um, hey, Mom, I have discovered a cure for cancer. Very nice. Shame you couldn't do it in time to save Uncle Walter's left testicle. Come on. Give me another one. No, I get the idea. No, hit me. Okay, um... Gee, Mom, it really is a beautiful day, huh. Try telling that to Uncle Walter's one good nut. Okay. Um, I adore my son. Somebody has to. How about friendship. How about Judas. Family. Manson. Puppies. Rabies. Love. Communicable disease. You win. Quitter! Leave me alone. You're already alone. Your wife threw you out, remember. âª Men. ROSE: Damn it, Gordon. Get up there and talk to Charlie. GORDON: But I don't want to talk to Charlie. ROSE: Do you like having s*x with me, Gordon. Hey, Charlie. Hey, Gordon. What's going on. Oh, not much. I was just passing by. Thought I'd see how you're doing. I'm doing fine. Good. Good... Nice shirt. Right back at ya. So... Rose says I have to talk to you, or I can't have s*x with her anymore. I see. You sure you're making the right choice. Call me crazy. Well, crazy is the price of admission for that ride. Okay, come here, sit down. Oh. You want a beer. Oh, no, thank you. I'm a really mean drunk. I sensed that. Anyway, the thing you need to understand about Rose... About any woman really is... They want what they can't have. But Rose can have me. Trust me on this, Gordon. Play it cool, keep your distance, be aloof, you'll have to call the cops to get rid of her. You really think so. I know so. But they won't come right away. She'll still have time to hot glue her high school graduation picture to your freshly shaved ass. âª Men. Hey, Mom, here's some good news. It seems with medical breakthroughs, the average lifespan will soon be a hundred years. Wonderful. More time to be ignored by your children. Amazing. Morning, Mom. You're looking very pretty today. That's nice, because inside I'm dead. When you're right, you're right. Charlie, I need a favor. Yeah, well, I need a healthy liver, and there's a long waiting list for both. I've got a client coming into town next Saturday, and he's bringing his lovely daughter. Uh, and by "lovely," she means "dog-like.. All right, she may not be a beauty queen, but she does have a terrific figure. I'm guessing six nipples. Anyhow, I was hoping you could show her a good time. No big deal. You don't even have to take her to dinner. Just go to the beach and throw a stick till she gets tired. Gee, Mom, as much as I'd love to service the unfortunate little schnauzer, I'm busy next Saturday. What are you doing. I've... I've... I've got a... uh... I got a... I got a thing. Don't lie to me, Charlie. You've got nothing. You just don't want to help me. No, no, no, no. I... I... I swear. I have... I have... I have plans. I'm... I'm... I'm going to this... this awards ceremony. You never go to these things. Yeah, well, this year's different. Your client's daughter will just have to hump somebody else's leg. Told you I could get him to go. This is really boring. Keep it to yourself, Jake. I just don't understand why I had to come. You're here to support your Uncle Charlie, the same way he supported you by going to your Christmas pageant this year. You remember the one, where you stood in back picking lint off your antlers while the rest of the class recited "The Night Before Kwanzaa.. Oh, yeah. Uncle Charlie. What. Now you have to come to my Easter pageant. This event isn't televised, is it. No. Hmm. Well, I guess they only show the important awards. Congratulations. You've just been elected tonight's designated driver. Come on, just ignore her. Ignore her? It would be easier to ignore blood in my urine. Well, well, well. Look who decided to be a good sport. Speaking of blood in my urine. Hey, Archie. Hey, I want to tell you people, this man has been a real inspiration to me. No, come on. No, no. I mean it. Whenever I'm struggling to write a jingle and I feel like I'm not measuring up, I ask myself, how would Charlie Harper write this. And the answer always makes me feel better about my own work. So, Charlie, aren't you going to introduce me. Mom, Archie. Archie, Mom. You're Charlie's mother. Oh, a teenage pregnancy, no doubt. How brave of you to keep him. Well, aren't you adorable. . . . . Mom, Archie is nominated in the same category as Charlie. Oh. Well, I'll be rooting for you, Archie. Okay, then, thanks for stopping by. Good luck. You deserve it this year. Thanks. I mean, how many times can they snub you. I don't really keep track. Seven. Seven years in a row. If you say so. Hey, stick around after the ceremony. If I win, I'll let you hold my trophy. Not to mention the little statue they give me. Isn't the little statue the trophy. Just eat your chicken. And now, before we present the Jingle of the Year Award, we have a special treat. Please tell me they're gonna pass out guns. Our very own seven time award winner, here to perform his own nominated tune, composed especially for the United Nations. Save-an-Orphan program... Oh, God, not orphans. Archie Baldwin. Oh, goodie. [PIANO PLAYING GENTLE TUNE. This is for all the orphans out there. âª There's no tree at Christmastime . âª No pumpkin Hallow's Ev. âª No candles on the birthday cake . âª No reason to believ. âª He works all day in a cold, dark mine . âª His little lungs filled with soot . âª Her mom is Kim Jong's concubine . âª Her dad was killed by the Tonton Macoute . âª Save the orphan. âª Ah... . âª Save the orphan. âª Don't do it for m. âª Don't do it for yo. âª Do it for little Kim Sung, [CLICKING NOISE] and Abu . âª Save the orphan. âª Ah... âª Come on, everybody. âª Save the orphans âª Ah... âª Tax deductible. âª Save the orphan. âª Save the orphan. âª Save the orphans Woody Allen can't marry them all. âª Save the orphans Some of them don't even have parents. âª Save the orphans Get two, get one free. âª Save the orphans You're the ones paying for scholarships. âª Save the orphans... âª Save the orphans . âª Ah... âª Save the orphan. âª Ah... Enough. But it's catchy. So is diphtheria. How come you don't get a runner-up trophy. 'Cause I don't. In school, everybody gets a trophy just for participating. Well, Jake, that's the difference between school and life. In life, all you get for participating is pain, loneliness and death. [CAR HORN HONKS. Better luck next year, Charlie. Good night, boys. Oh, yeah, I forgot. There's also crushing humiliation. Huh. Well, in sixth grade, you get a trophy. âª Men. Hey. Can I get you anything. A length of rope and a rickety stool. Charlie, it's understandable that you might be a little blue right now. But that will pass. Get out of here, Alan. You know, I often find that when things look darkest, it really helps to share your... I swear, I will drop-kick you over that railing. All right. Pleasant dreams. You don't dream in a blackout, you moron. Hey, Charlie. Oh, God. How'd it go tonight. Well, let me put it this way. What the advertising community did to me earlier this evening, Archie Baldwin is now doing to my mother. He's not acknowledging her wonderful talent. Just leave it alone, Rose. Sorry. Have you seen Gordon. Not since I talked to him. And by the way, thanks for that opportunity. I've always wanted to bond with a pasty kid who dresses like me. Well, I don't know what you said to him, but he's been acting very strange, lately. Lately. I keep calling, but he doesn't pick up the phone. And when I leave a message, he doesn't call back. I thought you wanted him to stop being so clingy. I thought I did, too, but now I miss his cute little face peeking at me while I'm washing my hair, shaving my legs, soaping up my breasts, which you no doubt remember are extremely firm and perky. So he spies on you in the shower. No. That would be weird. Why is love so complicated. I don't know, Rose. Stuff happens. Oh, Charlie, you always know the right thing to say. Well, this is a fine kettle of fish. Oh, why can't I just black out in peace. "Be aloof," you said. "Play hard to get.. You just wanted me out of your way so you could make your move. You caught me, Gordon. Now do the right thing and kill me. Oh, Charlie, is this true. Is this part of some devious plan to win me back. You heard her, Gordon. Kill me. Rose, you wanted him out of your hair, I got him out of your hair. You wanted to get rid of me. No. I just need some space. You want space. I'll give you all the space you want. Fine. In fact, I'll leave right now. Well, great, I'll just stay here with Charlie. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody leaves. Nobody stays. Rose, get off me. Okay, now, everybody listen carefully, 'cause I'm pretty sure I'm only gonna be able to say this once. Rose, think about it. Where are you gonna find a guy who loves you as much as Gordon. And Gordon, where are you gonna find a girl... period. The man makes sense, Rose. Damn right, I make sense. If you kids don't patch things up, you know what's gonna happen. You're gonna wind up old, miserable and alone. He's right, Gordon. Look what happened to him. I love you, Rose. I love you, too. Oh, good, a happy ending. Get the hell off my deck. Come on, lamb chop, let's go home. Hold on. Climbing over the rail is ridiculous and juvenile. From now on, I want to take the stairs. Do you like having s*x with me, Gordon. Call me crazy. [CLAPPING. And the real winner tonight is Charlie Harper, a man with a heart so big that he'd step outside of his own misery to help two people in need. Alan, I'm warning you. Now, I know you don't want to hear this, but let me tell you something. The Archie Baldwins of this world are soon forgotten. It's people like you, people who are selfless and generous, who will live on forever. Last chance. Oh, please. That Grumpy Gus routine is not... Good night

season	Season-03jßdEditor: Jk2writ. Morning. Morning. What are you making. Breakfast. Have you considered orange juice and a piece of toast. It's in there. We got any marshmallows. And he wonders why he gets diarrhea. [BLENDER WHIRRING, LIQUID SLOSHING. Oh, man. You forget to put the lid on again. Maybe. Well, clean it up. Okay. Is Jake up yet. He's in the kitchen. Has he been looking for me. Are you a marshmallow. What. He hasn't been looking for you. Oh, good. Sorry, I'm late, but Kandi and I had morning s*x. Good for you. Twice. Congratulations. She didn't even wake me up for the first one. I almost missed it. Well, I've always said a 22-year-old girl is like a good carpenter: no wood gets wasted. Well, I wouldn't put it so crudely, but, yeah. [YAWNING. Morning, buddy. Morning. Why do you let him use the blender. I'm hoping he'll eventually stumble into a margarita. Hey, here's a fun fact. You're sleeping with a girl who was born when you were in junior high. And yet there's a good chance she lost her virginity before you did. And here's another fun fact. I'll bet she's had s*x with more girls than you, too. That is a fun fact. And you know what else. Here youth is-is like an aphrodisiac. I feel younger. I feel more... oh, I don't know how to describe it. [LAUGHS] Manly. I know what you mean. And I am performing at what can only be described as a very enhanced level. Right. You know, between-the-sheets-wise. You don't have to tell me. Yes, I do. I have to tell everybody. Hey, I'm just impressed that you can keep up with her. I thought by now, she'd have worn you down into a few vertebrae and pool of spinal fluid. You know, I exercise, I eat right... [DOORBELL RINGS. And of course, I've always had a vast untapped reservoir of sexual energy bubbling under the surface. Truth be told, you could drill anywhere and hit a gusher. Morning, brother. We're here to tell you about the good news. Yeah, okay, but, my news first. See, I'm dating a 22-year-old woman... incredible. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª âªOo. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men âª âªOoh âªOo. âª Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh âªMen, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ah. âªMen. âªMen. Hey, Charlie. Hey, Rose, what's up. I was just takin' a walk on the beach with my boyfriend, and we thought we'd stop by. Come on up, lamb chop. [GRUNTING]: This is ridiculous. I still don't understand why we can't use the stairs over there. Don't try to change me, Gordon. So, how's it goin' with you two. It's just great. Gordon's my soul mate. He completes me. We're inseparable. Yeah. Wait here. I want to talk to Charlie alone. Charlie. Coming. "Lamb chop". I'm hot and juicy. What's up. Don't play innocent with me. I can see the hurt in your eyes. What. You have to let me go, Charlie. Okay. I'm with Gordon now. I've moved on. Good. And I know it may be hard for you to hear this, but he satisfies all my needs. Well, he is hot and juicy. Oh, Charlie, I can't bear to see you like this. Like what. I know I shouldn't, but... I'm going to give you one last chance. One last chance for what. You're going to make me say it, aren't you. Say what. Listen closely. Once I go, I'm gone. Really? I've never seen that side of you. I've never had a man like Gordon. I believe you. So. So, what. Who's that. That's Gordon, my boyfriend. How come he's not allowed in. I'm trying to avoid an awkward situation. Too late. You bringing him to my birthday party. Oh, what do you think, Charlie. Is the wound too fresh. I think I can handle it. Cool. Okay, I'm going to go now. All right. But before I do, I think we need to decide just where we stand. You're kidding. Rose has a boyfriend. Yep. A real one or like "Toby the astronaut". No, this one's real. What's he like. Nice guy. Has no idea how close he is to the wood chipper. KANDI: Hello. Alan, you home. Kandi. What are you doing here. KANDI: I thought I'd surprise you with a booty call. ALAN: Shh. Lower your voice. KANDI [DEEP VOICE]: Booty call. What's a booty call. Well, it's... You know, this is more the kind of thing a-a son should learn from his father. Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask him now. All right. I'm going to hell. Look, it's a really sweet gesture, but this is not a great time. Hey, Dad, what's a booty call. Oh, oh, hey, Jake. You, uh, you remember Kandi. Sure. Hi, Kandi. Hi. So, what's a booty call. I figured you didn't want me telling him. Was I wrong. Uh, uh... uh, well, uh, Jake, it-it means, uh, that... uh, that Kandi came by to-to, uh, to do her laundry. I don't see any laundry. Good-good point, Charlie. Always the eye for detail. Uh... well, uh, you see, Jake, um... in the Old West... uh, uh, cowboys could be out on the dusty range uh, uh, for months at a time, and, uh, they'd get mighty dirty. Um, so, they'd, uh, they'd, uh, mosey into town, uh, with nothing but the clothes on their backs, and they'd need to-to wash 'em. So what they'd do is, uh, they-they would go down to the-the... crick, uh, and strip down until they were wearing nothing but their boots. Why'd they keep their boots on. Rattlesnakes. Uh, anyway, um, in order to warn people who were swimming that, you know, the naked cowboy on his way, he would yell or, uh, or, if you will, call, um... "Booty.. "Booty.. Ergo, the booty call. Wow, Alan, you really make history fun. Well, thank you. So when did it start meaning casual s*x. Um, why don't you go play a video game or something. Okay. Great. Hey, Kandi, you wanna come to my birthday party tomorrow. Sure. How old are you going to be. Twelve. [GASPS]: Happy bar mitzvah. Well, this works out well. When you're not boinkin' her, she's got someone to play with. Charlie, weren't you listening. Jake just invited Kandi to his birthday party. Oh, don't worry. You've still got the inside track. No. I can't let her come to the party. Why not. "Why not?". My ex-wife is going to be there, all her miserable, middle-aged soccer mom friends are gonna be there. They're going to take one look at Kandi's tight, young, little body, and they're going to hate me. They're going to hate me with a white-hot hatred of burning... hate. Yeah, sure, it'll be a little tense at first, but you can lighten the mood with your booty story. That's powerful funny, pardner. [FEIGNS LAUGHTER] Shut up. Alan. There comes a time in every man's life when he has to make a choice: does he want to be loved or does he want to get laid. 14 years ago, you made the wrong choice. You got married. And you wound up with neither. But now, now fate has given you another chance. Welcome it. Embrace it. Grab its pert little ass. What am I supposed to do. Walk into my son's birthday and say, "Hey, everybody, look at this gorgeous 22 year-old woman I'm having s*x with". Oh, don't be silly. You don't want to rub their faces in it, you just want them to know where yours has been. Oh, yeah, one more thing. Yeah. Booty! Booty. [WHISPERING]: Uncle Charlie. Uncle Charlie, you awake. Go away. Don't you want to be the first one to wish me a happy birthday. Jake, I swear to God... Wait, not yet. Five, four, three, two, one. Okay, now. Get out. You can give me your present now if you want to. If you leave immediately, I'll give you the gift of life. All right. Hey, how come Dad's not in his room. He's out with Kandi. When's he coming home. Not for a while. Why doesn't he just have s*x with her here. What makes you think he's having s*x with her. I don't know, common sense. Look, the thing is, he's embarrassed about having that kind of a relationship with somebody so much younger than him. Why. I don't know, maybe he thinks he's setting a bad example for you. What am I going to do? Start dating a six year-old. Go back to sleep. I can't, I'm too excited. Well, do you mind if I go back to sleep. Okay. I'll find something to do. Great. Maybe I'll try to make a pizza. Good for you. Oh, crap. WOMAN: Pierre. Have you seen Pierre. Is Pierre a cat. Yeah. Bathroom. Thanks. Excuse me. Hey. Hey. Oh, God. Just a little quicker. [TV CARTOONS PLAYING. Hey, I'm watching that. Yeah, right. Happy birthday, you big dope. Why am I a big dope. When did you finally fall asleep. How could I possibly know that. And now you got a party starting in a couple hours and you feel like hell, right. Yeah. Happy birthday, you big dope. Hey, am I old enough to have coffee now. You still think armpit farts are funny. . . . . Yeah. Then, no. Come on, I could really use a pick-me-up. Okay, how do you want it. I don't know, in a cup. Good choice. Feel better. Yeah, I think it's working. You know, Kandi, you don't have to feel obligated to go to this party. It's just going to be a lot of kids playing silly games. Are there going to be balloon animals. 'Cause I love those. Uh... no, uh... Jake's a little old for that. Balloon animals are a very under-appreciated art form, Alan. Just give me a minute to get ready. Okay. You know... it's probably going to be a very, very dull party. I wouldn't be going myself if I weren't related to the kid. And without balloon animals, you got to ask yourself, is it really worth the trip. How do I look. [GAGGING. I-I'm sorry, I think I swallowed my tongue. Thank you. It's amazing... my ex-wife would take hours getting ready, and the end result wouldn't be nearly so... this. Well, maybe I can give her a few tips at the party. Oh, gee. She doesn't respond well to tips. Okay. Anything else. Well... even before I say it, I know it sounds insane, but do you think you could put on a few more clothes. Don't I look okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, you look terrific. It's just... I wouldn't want people to get the wrong idea. About. About... Maybe if you could put on a jacket and a hat. Do you have a poncho. Are you ashamed of me. No. No, I'm proud of you. In fact, I'm so proud that yesterday I almost signed up to be a Christian missionary in the Sudan. But you don't want your family and friends to see me. Oh, good, you understand. You know, Alan, my friends are judgmental, too. About what. About you. None of them get why I'm with you. Well, uh... at the risk of shining a light on something better left unexamined... why are you with me. Because you're cute and smart and really, really grateful. All true. And if my friends can't understand that, well then, tough tomatoes. Kandi, you're a remarkable girl. Thank you. Unfortunately, so am I. Oh, come on, it'll be fun. Want to have a quickie in the car. [SIGHS. Well, all right. But this time let's pull over first. Boring. So where's Alan. He's supposed to be pitching in at this party. I don't know, but I'm guessing that wherever he is... he's pitching. So I suppose Charlie hasn't told you that I have a new man in my life. Oh, good for you, dear. Does the man know yet. Get your own, Red. Nice outfit. Thanks. Rose picked it out for me. How about that. Do you know, uh... sometimes when we're having s*x, she calls out your name. No kidding. What about the other times. She makes me call it out. Boy... that really wasn't a quickie, was it. The first one was. Anyway, so just to reiterate, today is Jake's day, it's not about us. I know. So maybe you can just relax, and don't feel obligated to, you know, socialize or... talk to anybody. Don't worry, Alan, I'm not going to embarrass you. Right, right, I know you won't. So, to summarize what I reiterated, we're just going to play it cool, low key, nothing to be gained by drawing attention to ourselves. I got it. Don't ring the doorbell. Sorry we're late, but... I was having s*x with this gorgeous 22-year-old woman. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Come in and say that again. Jake, you in here. It's time to do the birthday cake. JAKE: Go away. Did you find him. Yeah, he's in the bathroom. Is he okay. I don't know. Jake, are you okay. JAKE: I'm fine, go away. He's probably humiliated because his father's dating a Campfire Girl. Give it a rest, Judith. What's going on. Jake won't come out of the bathroom. Jake, come on out, honey. I can't. Why not. JAKE: I just can't. I was wondering where everyone snuck off to. Whatever you're saying about me, you can say right to my face. This isn't about you, Mom. [SCOFFS. I wish I could believe that. What's the holdup. He won't come out of the bathroom. Is he sick? Who won't come out of the bathroom. Your grandson. Why? Is he mad at me. Jake, honey, what have you had to eat today. JAKE: Just a little coffee and some vitamins. Coffee? You let him have coffee. No! You let him have coffee. He had a sip. Well, wait a second. Why did he take vitamins. JAKE: I was tired. Okay, but where did you find vitamins to take. In your medicine cabinet. I don't have any vitamins in my medicine cabinet. Yeah, you do. The little blue ones with a "V" on them. Ooh... What's going on? I don't understand. The kid's going to need another party hat

season	Season-03j§iEditor: Jk2writ. [SIGHS. This is such a beautiful sunset. Thanks. "Thanks". You're taking credit for the sunset. Well, no, not-not-not the sunset, per se, but I did buy a very expensive house on the beach so we can stand here and watch the sunset, so... thanks. The fancy beach house works with a lot of women, doesn't it. Honestly. It's like a G-spot with two mortgages. [LAUGHS]: Well, just so you know, I'm not with you for your house or your money. So it's the car. Why would I care about your car. It's an $80,000 Mercedes. Yeah, so. What does it do that other cars don't do. It costs $80,000. [LAUGHING. Hey, I almost forgot. I have something for you. Oh, Charlie, you don't have to buy me expensive jewelry. Okay, nothing but cheap crap from now on. [GASPS]: It's beautiful. Read the inscription. "One month, two weeks, four days.. What-what does it mean. Well, since we've decided to go ahead and consummate our relationship, finally, I thought I should honor the time we've already spent together... exclusively... in a committed relationship... without any s*x... what-so-ever. So unless we have s*x before midnight tonight, you're going to need to buy a new bracelet. Uh-huh. You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you. Uh-huh. Well, since you went to all the trouble to engrave it... Don't even ask what I used as a chisel. [DOORBELL RINGS. Kandi. Hello, Alan. Is Charlie available. Because I wish to speak with him. Oh, oh, uh... uh, okay. Um, why don't you wait here, and I'll, uh, let him know. I would be immensely appreciative if you would. All righty. What the hell does... this mean. I was sending you a message. What, that you're a woman trapped in a man's body. Kandi's here. And you want me to call you Kandi. No, Kandi, the girl you were seeing before Mia. Oh... Charlie, she's been calling here for days. Don't you think it's time you let her know you're in an exclusive relationship with another woman. Yeah, Charlie. After all, it's bee. "one month, two weeks, four days.. Did you know that Alan's a woman trapped in a man's body. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh âª Men. So... are you going to go talk to your ex-girlfriend. Okay, first of all, sweetheart, she's not really an ex-girlfriend. Her name's Kandi. Thanks, Alan. With a "K.. Alan... And an "I.. Okay, so if Kandi with a "K" and and "I" isn't your ex-girlfriend, then what is she. Well, I-I-I'd-I would say she's more of a, uh, person who would drop by from time to time and, uh... yeah, that. And why haven't you told this person that you're in a committed relationship. Her name's Kandi. Boy, you're on thin ice. I think we both know why you didn't tell her. Well, if that's the case, then this discussion is moot... ...and we should go upstairs while Alan goes back out there and delivers a very credible lie as to my whereabouts. Alan. Well, I'm not half the liar you are, but I'll give it a shot. Shall we go upstairs and continue this conversation. Are you out of your freakin' mind. Okay. You're mad. I get that. So. Uh, well, Kandi, it's like this. Charlie's with another woman. Don't lie to me, Alan. Okay, uh, he's in Africa working as a scrub nurse for Doctors without Borders. Story of my life. That's the story of your life. It's not always a scrub nurse, but it's always Africa. Before you say anything else, I want you to know I've anticipated problems like this. Look on the other side of the bracelet. "I'm very, very sorry.. Huh? Huh. You know what your problem is, Charlie. It's that you don't really believe in this relationship. Not believe in it. It's kept me from having s*x for over six weeks. That'd be like not believing in a serious groin pull. You know what Kandi is. I try not to judge. She's a lifeboat. You're keeping a lifeboat for when this ship sinks. Hey, hey, hey, lifeboats don't mean you expect the ship to sink... The relation-ship, if I may. What they mean is that you have a-a-a healthy respect for the... power of the sea. Are you listening to yourself. Yeah, I just caught the last part. Not well thought out. No. All my life, guys have looked at me like I'm just some kind of s*x toy. Well, they're wrong. Yeah. Just because you're good at something doesn't mean you should be pigeonholed. Uh-huh. And the only reason I'm so good at it is 'cause I practice. A-ha. Of course, all the practice in the world isn't going to help if you don't love what you're doing. A-ha. What do you want me to do, Mia, call every woman I've ever known just to announce that I'm now in a committed relationship. "Hi, Shirley? This is Charlie Harper. "We met at Disneyland about 22 years ago... "Yeah, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. That was me. "Anyway, I just thought I should let you kno. "I have a girlfriend now, "so I'd appreciate it if you didn't call me. Okay, bye-bye.. Well, that takes care of Shirley. Now what about Kandi. You want me to tell her? Fine. I'll tell her. I'll go tell her right now. But before I cut her loose completely, let me float a crazy idea by you. Sort of a win-win... win. Are you out of your freakin' mind. It was worth a shot. Kandi, before you say anything, I just want you to know that I'm in a committed relationship now and I'm-I'm-I'm really in love with this woman. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I can't imagine being with anyone else. Now, sweetie... don't cry. I'm sure you'll find someone else. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. What? I thought we were going upstairs. Okay. You're still mad. I get that. âª Men. I made your bed. Thank you. It's been real easy lately. How nice for you. You haven't even been flying solo, have you. That's a little personal, isn't it. Hey, you want privacy, wash your own sheets. Once I get my mitts on 'em, they're in the public domain. Good morning. Morning. How'd it go with Mia last night. Based on his laundry, not well. Why don't you tell the neighbors. Where do you think I'm going?. Oh, by the way, thanks for getting rid of Kandi for me. Hey, I'm your brother. I got your back. Good to know. Hey, as long as we're on the subject, I was wondering... since you're... swimming in Lake Monogamy, as it were... would you mind if I, you know, asked Kandi out sometime. Go for it. Just wanted to make sure you're okay with it. I'm fine with it. I just don't want you to feel weird. Thanks for your consideration. Morning, Huggy Bear. So, Kandi, you want to go out sometime. âª Men. Okay, I want you to know I tracked down Kandi. I told her she needs to move on, and she has, so I've got no lifeboats, no life preservers, no water wings. If the ship goes down, I'm going down with it. Charlie... So there's no longer any reason to put off you and me getting naked and rutting like a couple of pigs. Charlie, I'd like you to meet my parents. Hello. What if Dad says I can stay up to watch it. He won't. How do you know. Your father and I talk about these things, so don't try to play us against each other. I got to try. It's what I do. Hi. Hello. Is, uh, Alan here. Father Huggy Bear.... Yes, my child. You've got company. Alan. Stall 'em! Stall 'em! Stall 'em. KANDI: Okay. You must be Jake. Uh-huh. And you must be Jake's grandma. âª Men. Judith, hi. Why don't you go watch some cartoons. Okay. Cool. Are you proud of yourself? What do you mean. Oh, please, she has to be half your age. Oh, that. Yeah, I am pretty proud of that. What could you possibly have in common. What do you talk about. Talk? To tell you the truth, we haven't really done a lot of talking. I mean, I-I did hear her confession. She's been a very bad girl. And I'm supposed to leave Jake here. What kind of message does that send him. I don't know, dreams can come true. Life is beautiful? There is a God. Father. I suppose you're the one that introduced Alan to that slutty little... Don't say it, Judith. You'll just be demeaning all women. And yes. Figures. Well, I don't want her around my son. Oh, really? So do I get to screen the men that you're dating. And let's not forget, I know about that guy who delivered the truckload of sod. What about him. It doesn't take two months to put down a new lawn, Judith. Sounds like she got laid before the sod did. I'm not gonna dignify that with a response. Watch out for crabgrass. So what's Kandi, a nun. Mm, Catholic school girl. Oh, excellent choice. Oh, uh, hey, how are things with Mia. Not bad. She forgives me. Introduced me to her parents. Oh, really? How'd that go. Well, you know, those things are always awkward. But the big news is, I'm taking Mia to the Bel Air Hotel tonight, where we will finally express our love for one another in the way that we were meant to. Drunk and in a hurry. You got it. âª Men How's the caviar. It's perfect. Everything's perfect. Would you like me to build a fire. Oh, don't go to any trouble. It's no trouble. Luckily, I was a Boy Scout in Beverly Hills. Champagne? No, thanks. I want to be completely present for the first time we make love. Oh. Good for you. Don't you want to be present. Uh, well, within reason. Come on. What do you say we save the champagne. But I already opened it. Do you really need alcohol to make love to me. No, no. I don't need it. Well, then... . . . . Is something wrong. I don't know. I mean, we didn't hop into bed on the first date, we've gotten to know each other really well, we're not drinking... It's all so new to me. That's what makes it special. I just don't want either of us to be disappointed because one of us might not be... throwing their "A" game tonight. Are you nervous. No, no, of course not. But, you know, of the two of us, only one can... fake an "A" game. There's nothing that you could do to disappoint me tonight, Charlie. No. It's what I can't do that might disappoint you. You just relax. I'll be right back. Okay. Why don't you put some music on. Okay. Should I ask. I wish you wouldn't. I'm not supposed to play this game, 'cause my mom says it's too violent. It has to be violent. You can't negotiate with zombies. Don't tell me, tell her. I don't think she likes me. She doesn't really like anybody. Except the guy who keeps putting grass in our backyard. Okay... time for bed. Just a little longer? We're not sleepy. No, him. Oh... I get to stay up. That's not fair! Jake. Just 'cause she's a girl. Want to play. Oh, no, thanks. I-I thought maybe we could just talk. [CHAIN SAW BUZZING] Hang on, let me just saw off this zombie's head. [ZOMBIE SHRIEKING. Good Lord. There we go. Now let me save my work. Okay. All done. Want to have s*x. Uh... Uh, actually, I-I do. Um, but, uh, maybe we could spend a little time getting to know each other first. All right. What do you want to know. Uh... well, do you have any brothers or sisters. I do not. How about you. Well... Charlie. Oh, right, Charlie. Uh, do you like to read. Oh, yeah, I love reading. Oh, great, great, me, too. Read anything good lately. You mean like books and magazines, not billboards and text messages, right. Yeah. Then no. Do menus count. Are you ready for me. Mia, if I were any more ready, I'd be done. [LAUGHS. [LOUD BANG. Sorry. Are you okay. I think so. Are you sure. Yeah, I'm fine. [THUMP] Ow. Are you okay. Yeah. But I think that's enough foreplay. See, the thing for me was that I never should have gotten married. I was young, I didn't know who I was, and, to be completely honest, I was just afraid of being alone. Wow. Can I share something with you. Uh, yes, please. This is communicating. This is how we connect. You shouldn't tell people that stuff. It makes you sound like a loser. No, it makes me sound like a real human being, a person with feelings and flaws. Tell you what, why don't we just go have s*x. Finally. âª Me. Oh, cheer up. It wasn't that bad. There were... parts of it that I liked. Would you please not go over the game film now. What's the big deal. What's the big deal. This is supposed to be the part of the relationship that I'm good at. You are. It... was... fine. I don't want to hear "fine.. I want to see your eyes roll back and the top of your head blow off. This isn't a carnival game, and the object is not just to swing your mallet and ring my bell. Well, we disagree. That's just your ego talking. Charlie, listen to me. I love you, not your money or your car or your house or your skills in bed. What's left?. Charlie... Oh, come on, come on. You're saying that if I was some pencil-weenied guy and living in a shack and taking the bus to my job selling oranges on the freeway off-ramp, you'd still love me. Yes, I would still love you. Okay. I understand now. Good. You're insane. Why, because I love the real you. No, no, because you think there is a real me. Would you believe I loved you if my eyes had rolled back and my head had blown off. It would be a start. All right, I guess we're just gonna have to try again. Hang on, hang on. How am I gonna know you're not faking it just to make me feel better. Honey, if I was gonna fake it, don't you think I would've done it the first time. Fair enough. âª Me. According to my girlfriend, underneath all the superficial cool stuff in my life, there's actually a real me. Hm, no kidding. Apparently, he's quite a guy. Well, I'd like to meet him sometime. Don't hold your breath. My girlfriend, on the other hand, has no idea who I really am, damn little desire to find out, and is only interested in riding me like a wild mustang and draining me of all bodily fluids. Oh. How do you feel about that. I think I love her. You know what. Love isn't blind, it's retarded

showTwo-And-Half-MenjÉuEditor: Jk2writ. Alan, I forgot my toothbrush, can I use yours. Oh, dear Lord, no. Do you have any idea how many bacteria can be transferred from mouth to mouth on a toothbrush. I don't know. How many. Okay, I-I-I don't know the actual amount... Then why'd you bring it up. Poor judgment. The point is, sharing these things is a bad idea. Are you saying you don't want your toothbrush in my mouth, 'cause, Alan... I know, I know. I get the hypocrisy. Just... just humor me. Okay, I have, um... I have hard, medium or soft bristles. Uh, I have straight or curved handles, and, uh, for your flossing needs, I have, uh, waxed, mint-waxed, unwaxed, and if you're feeling especially adventurous, may I suggest the cinnamon. Maybe I'll just wait till I get home. No, no, no, no, no, no. One day you skip brushing, and before you know it, your teeth rot away and you're begging strangers to start your apple. Fine. I'll take the pink one. I always wondered, what's the little rubber thing at the end for. Oh, it's to massage your gums. Oh. I thought it might be an eraser... but who writes when they're brushing their teeth. I-I-I don't know. What's the matter. Oh, nothing, nothing. Well, I-I-I kind of have to pee. Go ahead. Oh, no, no, I'll wait till you're finished. Are you shy about peeing in front of me, 'cause, Alan... Again, I get the hypocrisy. I-I-I just think it's important to keep a little mystery in a relationship. It's just peeing, Alan. Not necessarily. Um, sometimes when a man urinates, other muscles see that as a green light to relax. So you've never peed in front of a girl. Uh, well, my ex-wife, but, uh, after six, seven years of marriage, who gives a damn anymore. Okay. I'll brush out here. Thank you. Ouch. ALAN: What. One of my teeth hurts when I brush it. Well, when was the last time you saw a dentist. Alan, I see people all the time. They don't always tell you what they do. Hey, are you... are you done. 'Cause I got to rinse. No, I... I can't go when I know you're listening. Would it help if I sang the pee-pee song. Uh, the what. My mom used to sing it to me. âª Tinkle, tinkle, little sta. âª In the potty, not the ca. âª Up above the bowl so hig. âª Like the raindrops in the sky... âª Hey, hey, it's working. [ALAN PASSES GAS. Oops, green light. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Oh... âª Men. [ENGINE GRINDING TO TURN OVER] ALAN: Okay, okay, stop, stop, stop. [ENGINE NOISE STOPS] KANDI: Should I try it again. ALAN: Uh, not yet. Okay, now. [ENGINE GRINDING TO TURN OVER] ALAN: Okay, stop, stop, stop, stop. [ENGINE NOISE STOPS] Morning. ALAN: Morning. KANDI: Morning, Charlie. Need any help. Do you know how to get a 1981 Plymouth Duster moving. Yeah, yank out the eight-track and push it off a cliff. [MOCK GUFFAWING. You're useless. Sure. Hey, you got a little grease on your face. Where. Cheek. Oh. Did I get it. Mm, no, there's some more. Now. Little on your forehead. Yeah. Perfect. Now sing "Swanee River.. KANDI: Alan, should I try it again. Uh, no. I'm going to call Triple-A. KANDI: Good. No sense drinking over this. You must be so proud. Hey, hey, she may not be sophisticated, but she's street smart. Sesame Street smart. Just leave it alone. Let me ask you something. Have you stopped to consider the long-term cost of a relationship with a girl that young. Charlie, it's a free tow. Oh, sure, that's how it always starts... With a free tow... But who's going to pay to fix the car after it's towed. Um... "Um" is right, my dim-witted friend, and that's just the beginning. Girls like Kandi need all kinds of stuff, and the only way they can pay for it is through horny morons like you. So her car breaks down, and I should just dump her. This is a short-term relationship, right. I don't know... Trust me, it's a short-term relationship. I mean, Kandi's not the brightest bulb in the chandelier, but even she's going to wake up one day and wonder what she's doing shacked up with a penniless putz who's twice her age. Kandi's not like that. Just wait. Your first minor stroke, and she'll be boinking the cardiologist before you can scraw. "What happened?" on your notepad. Okay, for the sake of argument, let's say you're right. What's your point. My point is, you don't dry clean a rented tuxedo. You don't redecorate a hotel room. You don't order cable for a port-a-potty... unless you're really, really drunk. And you don't take on the bills of a girl that's got the attention span of a monkey chewing on a fly swatter. Okay, I-I-I appreciate your... How shall I describe it... Compassionate advice, but all I'm doing here is arranging for a free tow for a friend. [SNAPPING NOISE OUTSIDE. Alan, I don't think the engine's flooded anymore. Fire extinguisher? Under the sink. Thank you. Hey, you know, if you don't hurry up, you'll be late for school. I don't mind. Okay, well, that takes the pressure off. How come my dad's not bringing me. He's helping Kandi get her car fixed. Aw, geez. And him already broker than a headless hooker. Hey, how come my mom hates Kandi. What gave you the idea that she hates her. 'Cause she says so... a lot. All right. Why do you think. I don't know. She's pretty, she's fun, and Dad seems real happy with her. Well, little man, you just answered your own question. I did? What'd I say. It's like this. You ever see a kid at school who doesn't like his lunch but he won't let you have it, either. Oh, yeah. Russell Beasley. He'll spit on his apple cobbler before he'll let anybody else eat it. Well, this is pretty much the same deal, except your mom is Russell Beasley, and your dad is the spit-covered cobbler. I don't understand. Even though your mom doesn't want your dad, she doesn't want Kandi to eat him, either. Oh. You know, I like cobbler with ice cream. Way to follow a train of thought. Thanks. Well, I guess we should go to school now, huh. Couldn't hurt. I'll see if can find my books. Sweet kid. Yeah. Shame he'll never be anything more than a burden to society. Yeah. Do you know a good lawyer, Alan. No, but my ex-wife does. Why. 'Cause I want to sue the guy who sold me that lemming. Y-You mean lemon. I do. Okay. Did-did you get any kind of a-a written guarantee when you bought it. No, it was more of an oral agreement. All right, Mr. Harper, I've looked at your daughter's vehicle. She's, uh... she's not my daughter. Oh. Good for you. Anyway, the prognosis looks rather bleak. I-I understand. I mean, the vehicle was on fire. I know. What is she, like, 21. Twenty-two. And a half. Good for you. Yeah, yeah, but what about the car. Oh, the car. The car's got to be 25, 26 years old. I mean, can it be fixed. Anything can be fixed. Hell, they put a pig's heart in my Uncle Vinnie. How much. All of it. My Aunt Phyliss likes to call him the other white meat now. No, I-I mean, how much to fix the car. For you, three grand. What?. Once again, the car was on fire. I had to wait an hour before I could even touch it. But I only paid $800 for it. Eight hundred dollars. Well, dear heart, I hate to be the bearer of sad tidings, but there's a chance some unscrupulous businessperson has taken advantage of your good nature. Boy, that happens a lot. Well, $3,000 is out of the question. It'd make more sense just to get her a new car. Oh, Alan, thank you. That's the sweetest thing anybody's ever done for me. Good for you. Hey. Hey. Why isn't your car in the garage. I, uh... I loaned it to Kandi. Ah. And how much are you paying to fix hers. For your information, nothing. Nothing. Not a cent. I'm leasing her a Saturn. Tell me again about the free tow, Alan. Come on, she-she needs a car, and-and-and the lease terms are surprisingly reasonable. They're practically giving them away. Excuse me. Where are you going. I'm going to solve all your problems. Do you want to see it coming, or should I surprise you. [MOCK GUFFAWING. You're not funny. [PHONE RINGS. Hello. Hang on a second. It's your dentist. He wants to talk to you about Kandi's teeth. Thank you. Hi, Dr. Weinberger. Thanks for seeing her on such short notice. Can I have some privacy, please. Sure. Get your own place. No, she's not covered under my dental plan. Twenty-two and a half. Yeah, yeah, good for me. Did you get a chance to look at her tooth. Oh, oh, a-a-a-a root canal. Well, well, how much is that. Yow. Well, wh-what do you mean, there's more. Who told you to look at her wisdom teeth. That girl's got wisdom teeth. Okay, what's the worst thing that can happen if you don't take them out. How infected. All right, i-i-if it has to be done, it has to be done. Yeah, send me the bill. Okay, bye-bye. Here, aim for the cheap seats. CHARLIE: Alan. What are you doing. [PANTING]: Well, I'm in a little bit of a-a cash flow crunch, and I, uh... I thought I'd use this to-to pay some bills. I see. Mind helping me out. Sure. Promise me you'll spend it on food, not whiskey. My pain brings you a lot of pleasure, huh. I'm a simple man. [PHONE RINGS. It's your ex-wife. Oh, perfect. Get the bat. This is the bat. Hello. Oh, oh, good. I-I was hoping it'd be you. What? Of course I remember the Alamo. Oh, oh, oh, you mean alimo-ny. [LAUGHING. I was... I was thinking, uh, Davey Crockett, Jim Bowie... Oh, oh, come on, Judith, why can't we share a few chuckles. Oh, oh, no, no, I-I agree. There's nothing chuckle-worthy about a subpoena. Well, you know what? I will tell you what. Uh, I will bring you the check, uh, when I pick up Jake. I-I-I promise. O-O-Okay, okay, bye-bye now. You've got to pick up Jake. Why. . . . . 'Cause I don't have her money. It's in Kandi's mouth and-and-and Kandi's car. What about the treasure of the Sierra Madre over there. This. This is nothing. One car payment and maybe a bikini wax. Bikini wax. A girl's got to keep those up. It's a landscaping issue. You just got to buy me some time with Judith. What are you going to do with more time. You can't sell your blood; your ex-wife already took that. And if you sell your sperm, what's the point in dating Kandi. Well, uh, for your information, I-I do have other options. Like what. Well, I've been looking at, uh, uh, part-time work, and, uh, I have some very promising auctions on eBay. Oh, really. What are you auctioning. Well, a-a few rare books, a couple of lithos, a set of golf clubs... Since when do you play golf. Uh, well, technically, they're your clubs. You're stealing from me?. Oh, come on, you only bought 'em so you could go to Palm Springs and pick up lesbians. This is ridiculous. Why don't you just ask me to lend you some money. Would you lend me money. Absolutely... if I hadn't taken a bath on the Super Bowl. Well, I-I need to do this by myself anyway. You know, I-I still have my pride. Wow. You really think that, huh. Well, it doesn't matter as long as I have Kandi. She looks up to me. She-she thinks I'm special. She thinks I'm smart. She thinks gazpacho is Pinocchio's father. What can I say, Charlie. I'm-I'm-I'm crazy about her. All right, I-I certainly don't want to stand in the way of your happiness. Well, thank you. One question, though. Yeah. What are you going to tell Jake when he notices his change jug is gone. Oh, uh, it'll be okay. I left him a postdated check. It'll be good by the time he goes to college. Yeah, like that kid's going to college. âª Men. Perfect. Just perfect. Judith, I know what you're thinking... I'll tell you what I'm thinking. Your brother's a weaselly little coward who doesn't have the guts to face to his responsibilities... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's a little more to this than meets the eye. Oh, really? And I suppose you're going to explain it to me. I'm going to try, if you'll calm down for a minute and listen. All right, I'm listening. Are you calm. I'm listening. Okay. You know why Alan's not here. Because he's ashamed. Well, he should be. Judith, that's not listening. He's ashamed because no matter how hard he works, he just can't seem to get ahead. You know his business is falling apart, don't you. Really? He hasn't said anything. Because he's too proud. Poor guy lost all his chiropractic walk-ins to an unlicensed massage parlor that opened up right between him and the Jamba Juice. You're kidding. I'm deadly serious. Who's going to pay to have their spine adjusted when, for half the price, they can get their dingus dusted. Well, I wouldn't know about that. As it turns out, I'm a bit of an expert... and I'm telling you, he's going under. Oh, my God. Did you know he took a part-time job. No. But you didn't hear it from me. And please, please, don't say anything to Jake. The last thing Alan wants is to look like a failure in the eyes of that little boy in there. Of course not. I won't say a word. Thank you. Hey. Where's Dad. Just go with Uncle Charlie. Okay. Why is Mom crying. Because I'm good. I'm very, very good. âª Men. I'm really getting tired of pizza. Well... I'm off to work. Get used to it. [IN BAD ITALIAN ACCENT]: Enjoy-a your pizza. Scusi, signora. Um, Alan, what are you doing. Oh, Judith, I swear to God, I-I will get you your alimony as soon as possible... No, please, don't worry about it. Really. Charlie told me what's going on. I don't need the money right now. Really. I may not have mentioned it, but when my grandmother passed away, she left me a pretty substantial inheritance. Really. In fact, I want you to have this. Really. Pay me when you can. The important thing is you get back on your feet. [IN BAD ITALIAN ACCENT]: I'm-a so happy. Hi, Huggy Bear. Boy, I love the new car you got me. Hi, Mrs. Harper. Doesn't he look cute in a mustache. [IN BAD ITALIAN ACCENT]: I'm-a so sad. âª Men. [DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS. [SIGHS. How's that pride doing. It's nice they let you take a few home. It's in lieu of health insurance. Did you know they actually have a little machine that shoots the cheese into the crust. Is that so. Yep. It's a little high-pressure gun. Can't kill yourself with it, though. I tried. I got to tell you something, Alan, and this is from the bottom of my heart. I think that you are the stupidest man on the face of the Earth, but I admire your perseverance. You're going to have to talk into the other ear. This one's full of cheese. [SIGHS. KANDI: Is that my Huggy Bear. Yeah, it's him. KANDI: Hey, guess what. You know my roommates, Ellie and Emmett. Yeah. Turns out they're not really brother and sister, so they started sleeping together. Oh, that's lovely. Anyway, now they're going to get their own place, and I don't know how I'm going to pay the rent by myself. Huh. Oh, God, Kandi, I can't, I can't. I-I-I'm all tapped out. All I have left to put on eBay is a-a kidney or a lung. If I were you, I'd sell the kidney, 'cause lungs don't grow back. I'm sorry, honey. You're just going to have to handle your living situation on your own. Okay. Hey, guess what else. You've got a loved one who needs either an operation or bail. No, silly.

episode+)Episode-13-Humiliation Is a Visual MediumjårEditor: Jk2writ. Charlie. Yeah. I thought we said we were gonna take things slow. We did say that. I guess we can't be trusted. Charlie, talk to me. All right. You know what I'm gonna do to you, you dirty, filthy girl. No, not like that. Wrong way. Am I a dirty, filthy boy. No, I want to talk about us. We're a dirty, filthy couple. No, I want to talk about our relationship. Well, that redirects the old blood flow. Okay. So what about it. Well, you know that I really care about you. I care about you, too. All right, good talk. I just want to make sure that if we do this, we're doing it for the right reasons. Well, not to be contrary, but sometimes the wrong reasons kick everything up a notch. I just want to make sure we give our relationship a chance to grow. So you want to stop. No, I really want you. Mia, all this starting and stopping is really not good for my transmission. I'm sorry. I'm just so confused. That's why you're gonna have to make this decision for the both of us. Me. I have to make this decision. That's like asking the fat kid to guard the pie. I trust you, Charlie. Well, that is really low. Okay, we'll wait. Thank you. So what do we do now. We could take a walk on the beach. No, seriously. Oh, yeah. Walk on the beach. Great. I've always been meaning to do that. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh... âª Men. Good morning. Good morning. Looks to be a beautiful day. Slightly overcast, but that should burn off in a few hours, leaving us with another sun- dappled afternoon in paradise. You still drunk from last night or did you get a fresh buzz this morning. No, ma'am. I am quite simply high on life. Blotto. I'm not drunk. Alan, guess what I did last night. Jake. I'm leaving. No, Jake can hear this. Last night... Wait, wait, wait. Hang on, Charlie. You're about to tell us something that happened last night that made you happy. Yes. Jake. I'm leaving. Jake, stay. I want to share this with my entire family. Okay, I'm leaving. Berta, I consider you part of my family. Am I in your will. No, but neither are the rest of them. Now, listen. Last night, I, Charlie Harper, delayed gratification. What'd you do, wait till she fell asleep. Wait for what. Jake. I'm leaving. Sit down. What happened last night is I may have actually started a meaningful relationship. Charlie, seriously, go sleep it off. You're embarrassing yourself. Come on, listen to me. I think I might be in love with Mia. Big deal. You've always been in love with you-a. Very funny. I thought so. Did you think so. That was pretty good. He's eleven. He still thinks "milk, milk, lemonade" is funny. Oh, yeah. Hello! Grandmommy's here. Oh, great, tell Mom what you told us, Charlie. No. Tell me what. Nothing. Do you need a good lawyer? No. Discreet doctor? No. Knock-off Gucci handbag? What. There's only so many ways I can help you dear. It's no big deal. I've just been seeing this ballet dancer and I think she might be the one. Drunk. He says no. I think it might be one of those designer drugs. Charlie, what did you take. I'm serious. We've been seeing each other for over a month and we're waiting to sleep together until our relationship has a solid foundation. Well, we can rule out ecstasy. I mean, that's a powerful aphrodisiac. I've heard. Nowadays you're supposed to say African American-disiac. Jake. You sure this time. Yeah. I'm leaving. Has it occurred to any of you that maybe I've finally matured. Maybe I'm finally ready to build something with a woman that isn't solely based on s*x. Has that occurred to you, Alan? Nope. Berta? Uh-uh. So it's not just me. You know, I can understand your skepticism. I've earned it. But this girl is different. And I'm gonna make it work. I give him another week before he's out on the beach humping wet sand. âª Getting to know yo. âª Getting to know all about you . âª Getting to like yo. âª Getting to hope you like me . âª Getting to know yo. âª Putting it my way, but nicely . âª You are precisely my cup of tea... . . . Hey. Hey. How was your date. Fun. We went bowling. Still playing it slow. Ketchup slow. Glacier slow. Continental drift slow. So, slow. I'm saying. Hey, listen, about this living without s*x thing, I was hoping you can give me a little advice. Me? What would make you think of me. Well, I figured you get laid less often than a boil-covered dwarf, am I right. I don't have the actual statistics, but go on. Well, you must get really frustrated. I mean, how do you stop yourself from, you know, running a red light and then taunting the cop till he shoots you. Ah, good question. I found that the best thing to do is to focus on your career, uh, get a hobby, become involved in community activities and, at the end of the day, if you have any energy left, find a quiet space and yank it like a monkey in a mango tree. Interesting. Mm. What kind of hobbies are we talking about. Uh, well I tried collecting stamps, uh, building model trains, but, in the end, all roads led back up the mango tree. That's what I was afraid of. Hey, where're you going. I'm gonna go get in my car, run a red light and hope for a clean head shot. âª Men... The great thing about this piece is that it fuses a classical score with jazz choreography. Wow. You know, on a counter programming note, the Lakers are playing Miami tonight. Would you rather watch that. No, no, this is fine. Of course, I don't have a $500 bet down on the ballet. What channel. No, seriously, this is... Channel 2. You know Charlie, you don't have to give up things that you like just because of me. Okay, great. Good to know. Hey, as long as we're on that subject... ...there's something I want to run past you. Go ahead. Well, let me just preface it by saying that I am all for holding off on the s*x so our relationship can develop more, you know... deepness. I'm glad. I think it's working, too. We're getting so much closer than we would have had we just jumped into bed together. Good. Sounds like we're on the same page. And just to make sure we don't jump the gun, I was thinking maybe it'd be a good idea if I had an outlet that, you know, took the pressure off. An outlet. Yeah, an outlet. Something casual, meaningless. If I work it right, it could even be anonymous. You mean another woman. Well, that would be my first choice. But for the purposes of this discussion, let's stay with the more neutral term "outlet.. I don't care what you call it. You're asking for permission to have s*x with another woman. Only because I care about you too much to whore around without permission. Are you crazy. I can't go back to the mango tree, Mia. What. Look, I think this is a mature, thoughtful suggestion. In fact, there are many cultures that embrace the whole outlet concept as a way of strengthening and nurturing the primary love relationship. Oh... [BLOWS RASPBERRY. You can't dismiss entire cultures with... [BLOWS RASPBERRY. I'm going home. Oh, come on, we're just talking here. I propose an idea, we bat it around a little bit and then we compromise. That's the cornerstone of a healthy relationship. How are we gonna compromise, Charlie. Are you gonna have s*x with half a woman. Is that an option. What's going on. We had our first fight. Oh. What about. I simply suggested that as long as we weren't having s*x, it would be good for our relationship if I had s*x with somebody else. And she didn't buy that. Wouldn't even discuss it. Women, huh. They say they want to talk, but they don't want to talk. What's the matter with Uncle Charlie. Oh, he's just a little down 'cause he had a fight with his girlfriend. That's too bad. Why don't you go out and talk to him. Maybe you can cheer him up a little. How? I don't know. Tell him a joke or something. Okay. Might as well just give him a bowl of Milky Ways. Hey, Uncle Charlie, what's green, has four legs and would kill you if it fell out of a tree and landed on you. What. A pool table. That's funny 'cause you wouldn't expect it to be in a tree. Nothin'. Okay, I'll talk to him. Hey, if you can work up a fart, ask him to pull your finger. Hey. Hey. Still haven't heard from Mia. She won't return my calls. You do realize that suggesting it would be good for you to have s*x with other women was a monumentally stupid thing to do. Yes, Alan, I realize it. The question now is how do I apologize. You mean grovel. No, I mean apologize with my dignity and pride intact. Oh, you sad, naive fool. If 12 years of marriage taught me anything, it's that there is no apologizing without groveling. Mia and I aren't married. Are you having s*x. Continue. First of all, the phone's no good. You must grovel in person. Humiliation is a visual medium. Okay. Next, uh, don't go empty-handed. But, uh, keep in mind that any gifts you do offer may well end up being thrown at your head. Uh, flowers, lingerie, jewelry... all good. Picture frames, waffle irons, steak knives... not so much. You actually bought your wife a waffle iron. I was young. She liked waffles. Anyway, the most important thing is sincerity. Sincerity. Yes, you absolutely must be able to fake sincerity. You know what? I've underestimated you. You are far more deceitful and manipulative than I've given you credit for. Thank you. No, I was faking sincerity. Oh, that's very good. But all kidding aside, I really appreciate your help. You're welcome. Ah! Got ya again. That's... that was good. Oh, hey, can you do me a favor. What's that. Uh, pull my finger. You're bluffing. Try me. Give me another chance. I thought I had one. . . . . âª Men... . Hi. Hi. These are for you. Aw, you didn't have to do that. Really? My brother said I did. Well, thank him for me. Come on in. I just want you to know how sorry I am. Actually, I think I owe you an apology. You do?. Yeah, these are for you. Aw, you didn't have to do that. I shouldn't have gotten so angry with you. Not to say that your "outlet" idea wasn't incredibly juvenile, selfish, moronic... Whoa, whoa, whoa. I accept your apology. The point is, is that I really don't have any right to object to you sleeping with other women. We don't have a commitment. You're free to do whatever you want. Well, thanks. That's great. Very mature. So everything's okay now. No, you ass. If we're gonna keep seeing each other, I want a commitment. A commitment? Yes, a commitment. Does that mean we can start having s*x. Is that the only reason you'd be willing to make a commitment. It's in the top two. Well, I think s*x should wait until we get our relationship on track. Okay, okay, let me make sure I understand this. You want me to make a commitment that I will not have s*x with anyone else while, at the same time, I'm not having s*x with you. Yes. All right, let's come at this from another angle. We're gonna be sexually exclusive, but without the s*x. Well, I suppose you could look at it that way. [SIGHS. So bottom line... No s*x for Charlie... ...with you or anyone else, for the foreseeable future. Correct. Are you insane?. Charlie, if you care about us, it should be something that you want to do. What about you? What are you giving up. I'm giving up the same thing you are. Do you want to sleep with other guys? Of course not. Then you're giving up nothing. Tell you what, I'll give up s*x, you give up... I don't know... a kidney. Oh, don't be stupid. Okay, okay... dancing. Dancing's my life, Charlie. Aha! Now we have a level playing field. You know what, maybe you should just go. You're right... why stay here, when I can just as easily not have s*x with you in the comfort of my own home. Oh, go to hell. See. That's why you didn't get a waffle iron. âª Men... . [WHIRRING STOPS. Hey, how'd it go with Mia. Great. We broke up. How's that great. Because now I can go back to being who I really am. And who's that. Someone who doesn't care who he really is. Somebody who just has fun. Oh, I see. Someone who spends his life in a drunken haze having meaningless s*x with strangers. If you knew who I am, why'd you ask. Hurry, Charlie. I'm starting to sober up. Well, we can't have that. No, you might find out who she is. Here you go. Good. Boy, I haven't been this drunk since I took my S.A.T.'s. Doesn't seem to have held you back much. No, just one year. Sixth grade. Charlie, you okay. Yeah, I just got a lot on my mind. [SYMPATHETICALLY]: Aw... Do you wanna look at my boobs. No, thanks. You sure? It always cheers me up. [KNOCKING. Oh, Mia. Hi. Is Charlie here. Uh... WOMAN: Tickle, tickle. CHARLIE [LAUGHING]: Cut it out. That was great. Do it again. Alan, don't you think it's time you went out and kept your girlfriend company. My what?. Thanks for playing along. Oh, yes, uh, uh, uh... my girlfriend. Yes, uh, excuse me. Coming... Pookie. Well, this is an awkward moment. You are such a schmuck. Okay, the ice is broken. Good-bye, Charlie. Oh, come on, you said yourself we don't have a commitment. We don't even have a relationship anymore. You know what? You're right, Charlie. Go back to your bimbo. Hey, hey, hey, she's not a bimbo. WOMAN: Yay. I'm not saying she's a brain surgeon. No, wait. Mia. At least tell me why you came. You wanna know why I came. I came because, after I cooled down, I started to miss you. And I wanted to make love to you. That's great, it's wonderful. And it's not gonna happen. Why, 'cause of that bimbo. Let me tell you something. The entire time I was out there drinking and fooling around with her, I was thinking of you. Oh, swell. You know what I mean. I would trade a hundred of her for one of you. Are you saying you're ready to make a commitment. Yes. Maybe you want some time to think about it. How could that help. Look, I don't want to be with anybody but you, so... I might as well be committed. You're so funny. You wanna go upstairs. Not right now. Oh, please don't tell me you've got somebody in your room. No, no, no. No. I just think if we're gonna do this commitment thing, that the first time should be really special. What have you got in mind. Well, you know, candles, music and... maybe not having the girl I was trying to rebound with dancing half-naked on the deck with my idiot brother. Are you sure. Oh, yeah, he's an idiot. Call me later. Well, back to the mango tree. âª Men... . Ugh, what is this. It's a healthy cereal that won't rot your teeth. You got that right, 'cause I'm not eating it. Well, that's all you're getting. Morning. Morning. Morning. Is he in a better mood today? Yeah. Uncle Charlie, I got another joke for you. Okay. There's two muffins sitting side by side in a muffin tin in the oven. One muffin says to the other, "Boy, it's hot in here.. And the other one says, "Holy crap, a talking muffin!. I just don't think he knows what's funny

episodeEpisode-12-That Special Tugj­}Editor: Jk2writ. I just want to be clear that I am here as a last resort. I understand. I don't have a lot of faith in psychiatry as a science. I think some of the drugs you're pushing are interesting... and I'm all for messing around with brain chemistry. I mean, that's how I got through high school. But in my experience, popping pills doesn't relieve social anxiety quite as well as, say, bourbon and Marvin Gaye. Now I get it. You're desperate and I'm full of hooey. So in the words of Marvin Gaye... "What's goin' on?. Everything I say is confidential, right. Whatever you say, stays in this room. Kind of like Vegas. Well, except there's no way you're leaving here with more money than when you came in. Yeah, like Vegas. Anyway... last night I'm out with my stupid, lame-ass brother... Sounds like you've got some anger towards him. Oh, you're good. This is nice... you and me spending time together. Why don't we do this more often. I don't have an answer. Me neither. So how long till the movie starts. About 20 minutes. Yeah, sure. 20 minutes, not counting previews and ads, the popcorn and the giant pretzel holding hands, the big soda drinking the little soda, which frankly is cannibalism, and the always welcome reminder to turn off your cell phones and shut up, but nobody ever does because, let's face it, good manners are just the latest casualty in the ongoing collapse of Western civilization. I now have an answer. I miss Jake. How can you miss him. We just dropped him off at his friend's house. By the way, if you ever get tired of those magazines under your bed, the kid's mom looked fairly do-able. Forget the mom. Did you see how happy Jake was to be spending the weekend away from me. Why would you think that. Just because he jumped out of the car while it was still moving. Come on, Alan, he was happy to see his friends. Being away from you is just gravy. I know. I know. It's natural for him to want to spend more time with his peers than his parents. But all the same, it's sad. Yeah. Sunrise, sunset. One day, you're holding a little baby in your arms, and the next day, he's off hocking loogies and lighting farts with a bunch of Ritalin-addled sixth graders. Why do I bother trying to share my feelings with you. I don't know. It's not like I encourage it. Oh, come on. So your kid doesn't need you like he used to. That's a good thing. You can spend your weekends enjoying yourself. That's true. And there's things I want to do that I haven't had time for. Like that kid's mom. No, no, I mean like reading... Finally cracking open the classics. Alan, if you want to crack something open, I recommend that kid's mom. No, no, I'm serious. For years, I have been wishing that I had time to read all the great books. Dostoyevsky, and Hemingway, Faulkner, and Dickens, and Shakespeare and history. History: U.S. history, world history, the history of language. I mean, why doesn't anyone speak Sumerian anymore. I don't know because I haven't read the book. And, oh, oh... poetry, poetry. Byron, and Keats, and Shelley. And biographies! Oh. Julius Caesar, and Abraham Lincoln, and, oh, Groucho Marx. I mean, look at them all. Look at them! They're mocking me. I haven't read any of them. Okay, well, just pick one for now. Why bother?. There's not enough time. There's too many books and not enough time. Maybe you just need a system. You know, put a book next to the toilet, and every couple days, you knock out a couple chapters. No, no! It's too late for me. There's not enough bowel movements left. Maybe you need to change your diet. No, it's hopeless. Jake will be grown up soon and I'll be dead. And you know what I'll have left behind. A life of unfulfilled dreams, a shelf of unread books, and three unopened seasons of Six Feet Under on DVD. So what are you doing tonight. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ah âª Men âª All right. So your brother had a panic attack in the middle of a bookstore. How'd that make you feel. What the hell do my feelings have to do with anything. Why don't you just humor me. Well, I felt a little ashamed. Because you felt that his behavior reflected on you. No, because I left him there. You left him. Not permanently. I came back and got him after he was all cried out and it was time for the movie. So you still went to the movie. Yeah, I bought the tickets online. They don't refund those. Red Vine. No, thank you. I am so sorry. I don't know what came over me. Nah. Who among us hasn't collapsed, weeping, in the middle of a bookstore for no apparent reason. You know, I think maybe I'd be better off at home. So I'm supposed to miss the movie just because you had a nervous breakdown. Well, kind of. Don't you think that's a little selfish, Alan. It's just, all of a sudden, I felt crushed by this unbelievable sense of grief, like my entire life has been an exercise in pathetic futility. Well, I wouldn't rule it out. Come on, bunky, cheer up. Have a Red Vine. I don't want a Red Vine. Sno-Cap. No. Raisinets. No. Goober? How much crap did you buy?. They couldn't change a hundred. All right, I'll have a Junior Mint. I didn't get Junior Mints. Of course not. Story of my life. No Junior Mints for Alan... just Goobers. Goobers, Goobers, Goobers. Alan, be quiet. Why? Why. The first amendment gives me the right to yell "Goobers" in a crowded theater. Goobers. Hey, look. Movie quiz. Let's play the movie quiz. I don't want to play the movie quiz. Come on, it'll be fun. I'll bet you're good at it. All right, all right. "Debra Winger and Richard Gere starred in An Officer and a blank.. Oh, please. You need a hint. There's a hint upside down in the corner. No, I don't need a hint. I know the answer. Everybody here knows the answer. Everybody on the planet knows the answer. We're not stupid. Chill, chill. Oh, wait, here's another brain teaser. "Steven Spielberg directed this modern retelling of the H.G. Wells classic War of the blank.. Uh, uh, couch. War of the Couch. Stop it. Oh, no, no, I got it. War of the blow it out your .... You know, maybe you're right. Maybe we should go. Wait, no, I know this one. "Johnny Depp cruised to success in this comedy-action film inspired by a Disneyland attraction.. Pirates of the blow it out your .... He's behind on his reading. Oh, oh, and let's not forget Judy Garland in that immortal classic The Wizard of blow it out your .... That sounds like quite an episode. Is your brother seeing a therapist. How would I know. He's your brother. He lives with you. So. All right, go ahead. Just because I took him in doesn't mean I have to listen to him. I understand. He just whines about the same crap over and over. Okay. It's not even interesting crap. It's the crap that bores the crap out of crap. I got it. It's crap. Go ahead. Thank you. So we're driving home and... This seat is very comfortable. Genuine leather, nine-way adjustable, lumbar support... I wish I'd spent a few extra bucks and gotten the ejection package. I said I was sorry. They don't refund those tickets, Alan. I want to go see Jake. Why? He's at a sleepover. I just got this feeling that he needs me. Really? Some sort of telepathic thing. Exactly. I see. Ow. Did you know I was gonna do that. No. Then I wouldn't trust your psychic powers. Come on. We can just stop by for a few minutes. We have time now since we decided to skip the movie. Oh, we decided that, did we. That's the way it went down for you, huh. That's how you interpret recent events?. Whoa, whoa, settle down. You're acting like a crazy person. Me?. I'm acting like a crazy person?. Are you freaking kidding me?. Listen to yourself. You're getting a little scary right now. Okay, fine, you want to see the kid, we'll go see the kid. Thank you. Is that so hard. Charlie... the road. Please. You know, when you have kids, you find that there's a deep spiritual connection. You feel an actual tug when your child needs you. [DOORBELL RINGS. Interesting. What do you feel when your brother hates you. [KIDS YELLING. Alan. Is everything okay. Oh, yeah, fine. I just need to see Jake for a minute. He's feeling a tug. Tug. Or it could be gas. We're not sure. Could you just call Jake. Jake! Your father's here. Put that down, Timmy. What. I just wanted to see if you were okay. Oh, great. Now I'm dead! Thanks a lot. Doesn't count! I was talking to my stupid dad. Well, it seems like you've got everything under control. Actually, I ran out of ice cream. Do you think you could keep an eye on the kids for a few minutes. Uh... Thanks a million. I'll be right back. [CAR DOOR SLAMS. [ENGINE STARTS. [TIRES SCREECH. She ain't coming back. CHARLIE: Three hours she was gone. And when she finally came back, she was reeking of Old Spice and pot. I see. And she didn't even have any ice cream. All right, let's stop here for a minute and talk in general about your feelings towards women. No, thanks. Rather discuss your childhood. Nope. Father. Dead. Mother. Killed him. Would you like to discuss that. We just did. Charlie, I'm not sure we're on the same page here. Have you ever been in therapy before. Does massage therapy count. No. It's almost the same thing. One on one with a strange woman who charges you for an hour then only gives you 50 minutes. Why don't we just go back to your story. Touch a nerve there, did I. Okay, okay. Well, Jake ignored his father the entire time we were there, so Alan was a little upset when we got back in the car. He hates me. My only son hates me. He doesn't hate you. He just didn't appreciate you telling his friends that laser tag can induce epileptic fits. Well, it can. Be that as it may, you probably could've gotten your point across without flopping around on the floor, rolling your eyes up and pretending to swallow your tongue. Hey, hey, a-a picture is worth a thousand... Charlie, stop the car. Why. I have to get out. I... I'm feeling claustrophobic. There's no place to stop. We have to stop. Where. I-I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I-I have to get out. Okay... I have to get out now, now, now, now. Okay, hold on, hold on. [GROANS. Oh. The seat belt won't come off. Just push the button. I can't, I can't. It won't come off. Help me. Okay, okay, move your hands. [LOUD PANTING. Okay. It's passing. Yes, it's... Yes, I-I'm okay. No, you're not. What. Get out. What. Get out now. Now, now, now, now, now. . . . . [SIGHS. That's better. âª Men. He couldn't believe it, either. [CHUCKLES. You should have seen his face in the rearview mirror. All right, Charlie, we've been talking for quite a while, and I got to tell you, I still don't understand why you came to see me. You in a hurry. Doesn't that undermine your whole pay by the hour business model. Go ahead. Thank you. So, as I was driving away, I decided I needed a little quiet time for, you know, reflection and meditation. Hey. Hey. What took you so long. I was sure you'd come back. Huh. I guess that's case closed on the telepathy stuff. What are you drinking. I don't know. Something soothing. Uh, uh, Kahlua and cream. He's kidding. Give him a beer. Must you always embarrass me. I've had a traumatic night. Yeah, Yeah, okay, shut up, shut up, shut up. Hi. Hi. Yeah, hi. Can we buy you ladies a drink. No, thanks. We're already pretty blitzed. Boy, are we blitzed. Perfect. I'm Charlie. This is Alan. Amy. Beth. Nice to meet you. How's it going tonight. Pretty good. We're blitzed. How about you. Yeah, how you doin'. Oh, boy. Where to start. No one's talking to you. What's the matter, Alan. Yeah, what's the matter. Well, you-you really want to know. They don't. Trust me, you really don't. Well, maybe it's a-a late reaction to the divorce, uh, maybe it's my son not needing me so much now that he's growing up, but... But I think... I think it's more than that. I-I... I think it's just life grinding me down, and I just... [TEARY]: I don't think I can take it anymore. Oh, you poor baby. Poor, poor baby. Tell us all about it. Well, I was never a happy child. I was a miserable kid. And-And-And the only thing that gave my life meaning was my son. At least you've got a son. I've got nothing except... epilepsy. Oh, no. Really? Oh, no. CHARLIE: So anyway, there I was on the wedding day in front of the priest and all our friends, flopping around on the altar like an epileptic trout, when I heard her father say, "You can't marry this man. He's damaged goods.. Oh, gee. Yeah. Oh, gee. That's when I realized that all the money in the world... And I do have a lot... Can't replace that special tug you feel... when someone loves you unconditionally. Oh. Oh. Look, that's the ocean. Ooh, the ocean. Let's go skinny dipping. Yeah, skinny dipping. You want to come? Yeah, come with us. I'd love to, but I'm too sad, and I might swallow my tongue. You two go. Swim, splash, frolic, enjoy the healthy bodies. Okay. Bye. [GIGGLING. Have you no shame. Let me think. Nope. Just a tug. Now that's another thing. My angst is real. I-I do not appreciate you taking my tug and using it to get in someone's pants. News flash, Alan... they're already out of their pants. And they're gonna come back cold, wet, and in desperate need of body beat. Which means for those of us with normal skin temperature, it'll be a seller's market. You're unbelievable. No, I just think ahead. They're only gonna last about two seconds in that water, so we have to hurry. I'll get the wine, you light some candles, get a little ambiance going. I'm sorry, I'm really not in the mood. Are you saying that I have to get you liquored up so I can get laid. All right, I'll go along, but only as a favor to you. Thank you. I'm probably gonna have to apply the condom and get a rope and pulley to lower one of those broads onto him. Since you're making me do this, I get Amy. The hell you do. Which one's Amy. Amy's the one who overcame the eating disorder. Starving herself or throwing up. Does it make a difference. It does if you're paying for dinner. Amy is the brunette. Got it. So I have Jennifer. You mean Beth. Right, right, "B" for blonde. "B" can also be for brunette. But Amy's the brunette. So you could do "A" for anorexic. Unless it's "B" for bulimic. Good point. We're gonna need a new system. Do you smell something. [SNIFFS]: Yeah, what is that. I think you do these things just to piss me off. Oh my God, what happened. Well, while I was trying to put it out, my brother stupidly called the fire department. Why was that stupid. Have you seen a Malibu fireman recently. They're all young, buff surfer dudes whippin' their big hoses around. Amy and Beth jumped on their hook and ladder like a couple of Dalmatians. I never saw 'em again. Ah yes, the Malibu fire department. I have several patients who compulsively m*st*rb*t* to their calendar. No kidding. Both sexes. So anyway, Charlie, I'm still not clear on what it is you would like me to help you with. Uh, your anger issues, your sexual issues, your drinking. No, no, no, no, that's all cool. Then tell me, why are you here. Okay. Well, I'm here to lay some groundwork for the future. Some groundwork. Yeah. I've come to realize that there's a very good chance that I might some day snap and kill my brother. And I figure, if I'm already under a psychiatrist's care, then I can always cop an insanity plea. You're thinking of killing your brother. Shh. Doctor-patient confidentiality. âª Men. Check in the drawer by the coffee machine. Hey, what do you think of this for the new drapes. Too small. I don't know. I think it's kind of cheerful. I'll put it in the maybe pile. You do that. You know, we're also gonna have to reupholster the couch. You think. Well, there was a lot of water damage, which, quite frankly, I think was the result of the firemen showing off for the girls. You could be right. You know, I-I just want to tell you, I-I really appreciate you stickin' by me in the past couple of days, you know, pulling me out of my funk. You really are a great brother. I don't know what I'd do without you. I don't know what I'd do without you, either. But, golly, it's sure fun to think about

episode/-Episode-20-Always a Bridesmaid, Never a BurrojfEditor: Jk2writ. Hey, what are you doing home in the middle of the afternoon. Look outside. Huh. I guess the day got away from me. So, you still depressed. What do you think. Well, by the looks of things, I'd say you're one sad song away from deep-throating a shotgun. Be a pal and put down a tarp first. How did my life get to this point, Charlie. How does a man sink this low. Well, in all fairness, you had a running start. Sorry, sorry. Go on. Things were going so well. I had a young, hot girlfriend who fulfilled all my sexual desires. How many desires are we talking about. Just the one, you know. For s*x. But now she's gone. Aw, buddy. She's not really gone. You know where she is. Yeah. And where is that, Alan. Why are you doing this. Say it, Alan. The healing begins when you can say it out loud. My girlfriend is living with my ex-wife. You know, I was wrong. It's not the healing that begins when you say it out loud, it's the laughter. Nice talking to you. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Don't you want to hear how I can help you with all this. I am not going back to Tijuana for another X-rated live performance of The Bride and the Burro. Okay, okay, first of all, that's not what I was gonna suggest. But if you recall, that trip got you through a particularly dark, depressing part of your divorce. The first time you smiled in months was when you caught the bouquet. All right, all right. Against my better judgment, I'm gonna go ahead and ask. How do you propose to help me. Well, first, let's make sure that we agree on the problem. Your ex-wife has befriended your girlfriend. Yes. And your girlfriend has moved in with your ex-wife. Yes. And now your ex-wife is turning your girlfriend against you. How many times do we have to go through this. Just until it stops being funny. Anyway, anyway, it would seem to me the simple solution is to find someone to speak to Kandi on your behalf, someone she trusts. Yes, that would be great. Now what's your point. WOMAN: Charlie. If you're not coming back to bed, at least tell me where you keep the fresh batteries. I'll be right up. And it's rechargeable. My point is, I'm banging Kandi's mom. Wh-what. You're welcome. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª âª Oo. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men âª âª Ooh âª Oo. âª Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ah. âª Men. âª Men. CHARLIE [SINGSONG]: Who is it. You know damn well who it is. [SINGSONG]: I'm entertaining. [SINGSONG]: Not as much as you seem to think. Hang on. Not you. You let go. Come on in, Alan. Are you decent. WOMAN: He's above average. CHARLIE: Just come in. Come on. Oh, he's cute. I can see why Kandi likes him. Used to like him. Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry about that. Come, sit. Let's talk about it. Are you sure I'm not interrupting. Don't worry about it. We're kind of at the seventh inning stretch anyway. Wow, you can go two more innings. Even if I have to start throwing knuckleballs. Sit down. Okay. So, uh, you're Kandi's mom, huh. Mandi. Alan. Some grip, huh. Well, Mandi, I can see where your daughter gets her good looks from. Thank you. You know, a lot of people think we're sisters. Ooh, there's a mental picture that'll get me through the last two innings. Don't be naughty. Why, are you gonna spank me. I just might. I just might let you. I just might go hang myself. Oh, relax. Kandi said he was a little shy. You know, the first time they had s*x, he didn't even take his shirt off. Excuse me, that wasn't shyness. The first time I had s*x with your daughter, I barely got my pants off. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Boundaries. This is Kandi's mom. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to create an awkward moment. But enough about me. How is it that you two are... I mean, you know, uh, uh, how did you exactly... What the hell is going on here. Good question, and a great story. Mandi showed up here looking for Kandi. That's not a great story. Sure it is. It's already had like half a dozen happy endings. You are definitely going over my knee. Alan, we got to wrap it up here. But you said you'd help me with Kandi. I didn't say now. Do you want me to talk to her, Alan. I would really appreciate it. Excuse me, but the pitcher's all warmed up and ready to take the mound. Of course, I'm kind of busy at the moment. Got it. [MANDI AND CHARLIE HUMMING "CHARGE". MANDI: Charge. âª Men... . Hey, Dad. Hey, buddy... Mom, Dad's here. Shh, shh, shh. No, don't bother your mom. Is Kandi around. Yeah, she lives here now. Yeah, I know. Does this mean she and Mom are gay. No, it does not. Too bad. Why. It'd be a lot easier to explain. Could you just tell Kandi I'm here. Okay. Kandi, my dad's here. Shh, shh. What do you want, Alan. I want to talk to Kandi. I don't think that's a good idea. Why not. Because she's a sweet, innocent girl, and I don't want you to ruin her life, too. Too. How did I ruin your life. You stole my youth. You took my house. That seems like a fair trade. Face it, Alan. This whole escapade with Kandi is just a pathetic attempt to find a younger version of me. Are you kidding. Judith, I had a younger version of you, and let me tell you, it was no great shakes. It's okay, Judith. I'll talk to him. Oh, sweetie, he doesn't really want to talk to you. There's only one thing a man like this is interested in. What. Forget it. I'm here if you need me. [CLEARS THROAT. Listen, Kandi, I'm really sorry about our fight. I know I can be a bit of a control freak, but I honestly care for you, and I hope you'll give me another chance. I see. Excuse me. I can't let you steal my youth. You're not fooling anybody, Judith. Come on, Kandi, tell me what you think. Okay. I think we've reached an implants in our relationship. JUDITH: Impasse. I think we've reached an impasse in our relationship. Good-bye. Excuse me, is this Judith Harper's house. Yeah. She traded it for her youth. [DOORBELL RINGS. Hi, Daddy. Hi, sweetheart. Come on in. Judith can't wait to meet you. I can't wait to meet her. KANDI: I know you two are gonna love each other. [DOOR CLOSES. I watch one donkey s*x show, and you make me pay for it the rest of my life. âª Men... . CHARLIE [SINGSONG]: Who is it. Don't screw with me, Charlie. We need to talk. Give me a sec. MANDI: Charlie, you're just making it tighter. CHARLIE: Come on in, Alan. Hey there. Hi ya. You know, I can come back. It's okay, Alan. Come, sit. All right. So, how'd it go with Kandi. If it had gone well, do you think I'd be sitting here talking to two half-naked people. Alan. What. I'm completely naked. What happened, Alan. Well, as I suspected, Judith has turned your daughter against me. Well, I'm not surprised. Kandi's always been very suggestible. You know, until she was eight, she thought this was her nose. Aw, that's kind of cute. When Alan was eight, I convinced him he only had two weeks to live. But I suppose that tells you more about me than him. Yeah, good times. But back to recent events... Ooh, ooh. Remember when I told you the cat litter box was filled with Almond Roca. He ate four of them. [LAUGHS. Are we done visiting Charlie Harper's Museum of Sibling Cruelty. Because I actually have something to talk about. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was interrupting you. Go ahead, Alan. Thank you. So as I was leaving my ex-wife's house, I ran into your ex-husband. Andy. I guess. CHARLIE: Wait a second. It's Mandi, Andy and Kandi. What's your point. No point. Mandi, Andy, Kandi. Dandy. Anyway, it appears as if Kandi has set my ex-wife up on a blind date with him. How nice. Nice? How is that nice. Well, he's been kind of depressed since we broke up. It's good to see he's getting back on the horse. But that horse is my ex-wife. Speaking of which, did you ever see The Bride and the Burro in Tijuana. See it. I caught the bouquet. [CHUCKLES] So did Alan. Oh. [SIGHS] Always a bridesmaid, never a burro. Charlie, I'm starting to lose feeling in my arm. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. Hey, you went pretty far in the Scouts. Can you undo this knot. Gee, actually, I specialized in Indian lore... Beaded belts, arrowheads, but good luck, though. Maybe you should go get a pair of scissors. Hang on, let me untie my feet. [CLEARS THROAT. We really didn't think this through, did we. âª Men... âª So, has your mom been seeing a lot of Kandi's dad. That-that's right. If she married him, Kandi would be your stepsister. Hey, hey, do you happen to know if they're going out tonight. Yep, if I married Kandi, she would be your stepmother. But, but tonight, is your mom going out tonight. Yeah, yeah, I get it. If Kandi took a poop, it'd be your step stool. All right, well... it's always good to talk to you. Love you, buddy. Did you get all that, Berta. I think so, but let's do a quick recap. Your girlfriend's living with your ex-wife, your ex-wife is dating your girlfriend's father, and to top it off, you're trying to get useful intelligence from a kid who's got precious little to spare. . . . . Okay, just checking. CHARLIE: Hey, Berta, I want you to meet Mandi. Mandi, Berta. Hi. Enchante. Listen, uh... we got a pair of scissors handy. Oh, Charlie, that's a silk tie. Why didn't you use one of the poly blends. Hey, hey, wait a minute. That's my tie. You ruined my tie. Oh, yeah. You're not gonna be happy about your electric toothbrush, either. Kandi's told me so many nice things about you. How do you know Kandi. She's my daughter. Your daughter. Sweet whistling Geronimo. You people are like a box of hamsters, just crawling all over each other. Yes, yes. We all get how this looks, Berta. Hey, I'm not knocking it. I'm just wondering when some of that gravy's gonna spill over on my 'taters. âª Men... . [DOORBELL RINGS. Hey, what's up. "What's up?. What are you doing here. Well, Mandi came over to put in a good word for you, and I figured I'd tag along for grins. Oh, here comes one now. Come on in. I'm in a nightmare, and I can't wake up. Sit down, make yourself at home. Thanks, I will. Where's Jake. He's at a sleepover. Hi, Alan. How are you. About two heartbeats from a brain aneurysm. Where's Kandi. She's in her room, but I thought we should talk first. We just have a few questions. About what. Charlie. Well, Kandi's mom and I are a little concerned about your intentions. You should be, 'cause I intend to kill you. [SIGHS. Now, that's the kind of attitude that isn't gonna win you a lot of friends around here, mister. Alan, you're a very sweet man. But let's face facts. Kandi has her whole life ahead of her, while you... not so much. Kandi! Alan. I am so sorry. No, I'm sorry. Oh, isn't that sweet. I missed you so much. I missed you, too, Huggy Bear. Mom, I'm gonna go have s*x with Alan, okay. You kids have fun. Hold on there, young man. What. Don't be a selfish lover. Consider her needs. This isn't over. You're right, he is easy to screw with. Hey, four pieces of Almond Roca. Even the cat was laughing at him. So, should we head back to my place. I suppose. What's wrong. Nothing, it's just... we already had s*x there. Oh, baby, I really, really like you. Well, thank you, Judith. I had a wonderful evening, and I hope we can do it again some... [BOTH MOANING. ...maybe catch a movie. ...or go for a hike. Uh-huh. I'm guessing that's your ex-husband. Uh-huh. Good-looking man. Oh, he's gorgeous. Dumb as wood. JUDITH: Oh, my Lord. But it's good wood. I'll go find Alan so we can get out of here. You want to leave. This is so hot. Oh, Mandi, you just keep getting better and better. Hang on while I give Alan a heads up. Hurry back. Alan. [KNOCKS. Alan. JUDITH: You are the most beautiful man I have ever seen. Not Alan. I couldn't find him... Mandi. Mandi. ANDY: You know what else I like. Swap meets. JUDITH: Swell. Your ex-husband must be a real little guy, huh. Forget about him. Let's get some wine in you. Okay. Mandi. Glasses are in there. Mm. No, no, top shelf. Okay. That's what I'm talking about. JUDITH: Come on. Do you ever go rock climbing. It's a great workout. Mandi. Mandi. Mandi. Alan. Anybody. Over here. Oh, damn it. What are you doing. I was thirsty. Have you seen Alan. I've been in the closet. So where the hell is he. I'm sorry I'm so nervous. I haven't been with another woman in a long time. Yeah, yeah. Take off your robe. Okay. JUDITH: Hot damn. Yeah, it is hot. Hi, Daddy. Hey, Judith. Daddy, I want you to meet my boyfriend Alan. Nice to see you again. Small world. âª Men... JUDITH: Just get out. I'll give you a call, Judith. Maybe we'll hit some garage sales. Yeah, terrific. I like your daughter. I like your ex-wife. Want to get a drink. I'm not doing anything. Do you like garage sales. KANDI: Where am I supposed to go. JUDITH: I don't care, just leave. But I thought we were friends. Friends don't have s*x with their friends' ex-husbands in the first friend's hot tub. Yeah-huh. Divorced three years, and he's still ruining my life. I should have drowned his stupid ass. Did you hear something. Nope. How's the head. Let's find out


showTwo-And-Half-MenjËjEditor: Jk2writ. That's a cool snake tattoo on your back. Thanks. It's Anacoth, the demon who eats human souls. My friend Jeffrey has a dog that eats his own poop. He tries to lick our face, but we don't let him. Okay. Who's that one. That's the Goddess of the Damned... She whose name cannot be spoken. Why, is it hard to pronounce. What. We have a friend at school like that. He's from India. We just call him Rusty. No kidding. Does it hurt to get tattoos. Yeah, but it's worth it, you know. Sure. Once I bit my tongue really hard eating a frozen Milky Way, but it was totally worth it. Good morning. Hey, Dad. Hey. Hi, I'm Alan, Jake's dad. Isabella. She's a friend of Uncle Charlie's. I would hope so. Yeah, and she was showing me her tattoos. Oh, lucky you. There was a time when you had to pay a quarter and go into a tent to see that. Now, it's right at your breakfast table. Uh, go get dressed. I want to see the rest of her tattoos. Go. I have a quarter. Jake. [SIGHS] All right. Um... Isabella, I hate to be a fuddy-duddy, but we try to keep the house smoke-free. I'm sorry. Charlie didn't say anything when I was smoking in bed last night. Yeah, well, Charlie's lungs aren't always on the same page as his pen1s. Morning, baby. Hey. [CLEARS THROAT. If you don't like it, don't watch. [MOANS. I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower. You want to join me. Sure. Just let me get some fluids in me, so I got something to work with. Hurry. Anacoth is hungry. "Anacoth is hungry". She's referring to her snake tattoo. Oh. Her v*g1n*'s called Linda. Pretty name. Uh, listen, I don't want to overstep my bounds. This is your house and you're free to bring into it whoever or... whatever you choose. But I-I do think that I have the right to protect Jake from being exposed to certain people. Then you better take him to a hotel for a couple days, 'cause that girl ain't leaving till one of us is dead. Come on, Charlie. No, no, no, you come on. You see a little body ink and a cigarette and you immediately condemn her, but let me tell you something. She's smart, she's got a great sense of humor, and in bed, she moves like one of those paint shakers at Sherwin Williams. Nevertheless... I would rather she didn't hang around Jake. Fine. I'll talk to her. Thank you. You're welcome. Now, unless you want to lather up my fanny, I'm gonna go hop in the shower with Anacoth and Linda. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men . âª Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men. . âª Men. [SCREAMS. Isabella, I, uh... I didn't hear you come in. You weren't meant to. So... You think I'm a bad influence on your kid. Uh, well, gee, I-I wouldn't put it that way. But, you know, kids are, uh, impressionable and the violent, psychosexual imagery of your... body art... um, not-not to mention the smoking aren't necessarily something a young boy needs to... Why are you taking my hair. Just a little quirk of mine. Uh-huh. I used to collect stamps. You know, people like you have been persecuting people like me for thousands of years. Hmm. Well, that's a bit hard to believe, seeing as people like me have historically been victims and food. But, uh, just for clarity, who exactly are the people like you. Those whose eyes are open to a greater reality than you could ever imagine. I see. And do they all collect hair. Don't mock what you don't understand. I'm sorry. I tend to resort to mocking when I'm... totally creeped out. I don't like you. Yeah, well... I'm rubber, you're glue... something, something, something you. So be it. So be it. [WRY CHUCKLE. So be it. [SCOFFS. Ow. Ah, damn it. Ow. What the hell. [ISABELLA CHUCKLING MALICIOUSLY. âª Men. ALAN: I don't think so, Mom. First of all, I'm just not a big fan of costume parties. Well... yeah, Jake likes "The Wizard of Oz," but I just don't think he'd enjoy hanging out with a bunch of drunken real estate agents dressed like Judy Garland. Okay, I'll get him. Mom wants to ask you something. Hi, Mom. No. What happened to your face. Nothing, I just thought I'd put little blood-soaked pieces of toilet paper on it. What do you think. It suits you. Hmm. What's the deal with your eye. I don't know. I think I'm getting a sty. Huh. Might be a bit much with the toilet paper. I'd go with one or the other. Thank you for your input. No problem. Where are you going. Isabella's taking me to a party. She said it's going to be out of control. Can you imagine what this girl considers to be out of control. Well, let's see. Uh, biting the head off a live chicken. Vivisecting homeless people and playing hacky-sack with their still-beating hearts. What the hell are you talking about. Do you have any idea what Isabella's really into. So she's a little kinky. No, no, no, kinky is a feather duster up your butt. I think this woman tried to put a curse on me. Oh, please. Who of us hasn't done that. To know you is to curse you. She took my hair. She took your hair. Yeah. Yeah, and then she laughed lik. [LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY. Oh, well, that's different. So you see my concern. Yes, I do. Good night. Where are you going. To pick up a bottle of wine and a feather duster. [ELECTRONICA MUSIC PLAYING. You sure my Mercedes is okay parked on the street. I mean, I gave that crack whore $10 to watch it, but now I'm thinking, who's watching the crack whore. Don't worry about your car. Okay. So where are all the guys. How come I'm the only weenie in this pot of beans. Because this party is in your honor. Really? What'd I do. You're a vessel of the masculine life force. You picked up on that. I tell people that all the time and they just get snotty. These women are all my sisters. They all want to please you. Well, gosh, that's swell. Then you're okay with this. It was my idea. Let me tell you something, Isabella, you are just tops in my book. Hey, this is very tasty. What'd you say this was. Secret elixir. Secret elixir, huh. Well, I'm usually more of a bourbon guy, but, push comes to shove, I don't know what the hell's in that, either. Oh, boy. Getting a little fuzzy around the edges. You got any crackers. [SNAPS FINGERS TWICE. He's ready. You bet your gothic ass I am. Whee. Where are we going. To the altar room. Oh, boy. What's the altar room. It's where we anoint you. Oh, boy. I'm getting anointed. Sounds nasty. Anoint him. ALL WOMEN: Anoint him. ALL WOMEN [CHANTING]: Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him. âª I can't stop this feeling Anoint him. Anoint him. âª Deep inside of me Anoint him. Anoint him. âª Girl, you just don't realize Anoint him. Anoint him. âª What you do to me... Morning. Morning. Great googly-mooglies. What the hell happened to you. I'm not sure. Looks like you got bit on the face by one of them ebola monkeys. I don't think so, Berta. I mean, you weren't exactly eye candy going in, but... ...now, woof. You could scare the flies off a manure truck. Thank you. Until you said that, I was feeling a little self-conscious. Aw, you know I'm razzing you, don't you. Yeah. I mean, it's really not that... Oh, sweet Lord, I'm gonna lose my Eggos. Okay, if open mike night in the burn ward is over, I am just gonna make myself some breakfast and get out of here before Charlie's new girlfriend gets up. Why, is she not as compassionate as me. No. She's just a very creepy woman. Well, putting aside the whole pot-kettle thing, creepy how. Well, she's got tattoos all over her. I've got tattoos. And she's got this very dark, hostile attitude. Okay, you might actually like her. But I-I just don't want to have anything to do with her. ISABELLA: Good morning. Isabella. Hello. That's a nasty looking eye you've got there. It's... just a stye. Right. What else would it be. Hey, Vampira... tell Count Humpula to get out of bed so I can change his sheets. Charlie and I are spending the entire day in bed. We do not want to be disturbed. Do you understand. Is it getting cold in here. Do you understand. Yep, you betcha. Thank you. Bye, Alan. Take care of that eye. I will. Thank you. See what I mean about... What are you doing. Leaving. Why. Did you see that bitch. You got to put a whole lot of gone between you and a broad like that. But-but wait a sec... Good-bye and good luck. âª Men... [GASPS SOFTLY. [SIGHS]: Hmm... Ho. Ho. That is some stye. Oh, this is no stye. This is something else. Something evil. Something ugly. And you know what, I'm starting to think your girlfriend did this. Oh, come on. Charlie, this isn't just about me. Have you taken a look at yourself recently. . . . . Oh, man. It's gonna take more than a little spray-on tan to fix that. Do you realize how long you've been upstairs with her. That depends. On what. On what day it is. It's Sunday evening. I haven't seen you since last night when you went to that party. Oh, yeah, the party. That was some great party. What happened. I have no idea. Although I did wake up with this. Oh, my God. Am I Jewish now. Charlie, that's not a Star of David, it's a pentagram. It's a Satanic symbol used to call forth demons from Hell. Oh, that's not good. You need to cut Isabella loose. I can't do that. Why not. Because together we shall spawn a child named Giglamesh and he shall bring forth a new age of darkness. You know what, maybe it is time to slow this relationship down a little bit. Slow it down. You need to drive a stake through its heart. Is she still here. Yeah. Okay, here's the plan. [LOUDLY]: Um, so, uh, we'll submit to her will and, uh, serve the Lord Beelzebub with all our hearts. I'll grab Jake; you start the car. We'll drive somewhere safe, I'm thinking the Vatican. Don't be ridiculous. What are you gonna do. Well, you said it: we have to cut her loose. "We?" No, I didn't say "we." I never said "we.. Hear us, O Horned One. Wrap your dark wings around this young soul and grant him all the rewards he desires. Okay, um, hi, Mr. Horned One. Here's the deal: I'll trade you my soul for... What do I get, like, three wishes. He's the Lord of the Underworld, not a genie. Oh, okay. Can I talk to a genie. ALAN: Jake, get over here. Sorry, Dad, but you're no longer my master. The hell I'm not! Go to your room. You know, I'm old enough to choose my own religion. Go. How dare you interfere. Good question. Alan, tell her... how we dare. Hey, you brought her here, you get her out. Are you trying to get rid of me. Okay, well, no, not-not-not you personally. This is more of a legal issue. Uh, it turns out Malibu is not zoned for Satanic rituals. Or any of the black arts, really. Right, Alan? Uh, that's-that's true. Uh... You're fine in Hollywood. Um... Pretty much anywhere east of the 405 freeway, actually. Shut up, Alan. Just trying to help. Did you really think that you could just end this. Uh, I was kinda hopin'. Don't you realize that our souls are now bound together, destined to writhe ecstatically in blessed hellfire for all eternity. Boy, I know how to pick 'em, don't I. Charlie, do you remember the vows you took last night. Vows? You took vows? What kind of vows. If you'll shut up, maybe we'll find out. You vowed unending fealty to the sisterhood of the coven. You did that? Why would you do that. Will you please shut up. I did that? Why would I do that. Did you think that all those beautiful women were pleasuring you because of your boyish charm. Well, no, not-not- not-not all of them. I-I... I just figured after the first three or four, word-of-mouth started to spread. Wait, wait, uh, how many women are we talking about here. I don't know, nine, ten... 13, the sacred number. And a personal best for me. How do you have s*x with 13 women at one time. Well, apparently, you have to take some vows. Okay... okay, listen, uh, thank the girls for me, tell 'em I had a wonderful time, but... I'm gonna have to pass on the fealty stuff. I have a previous commitment to, you know, God. It doesn't work that way, Charlie. If you break your vows, you bring down upon yourself the ancient curse of betrayal. Well, that's just the chance I'll have to take. So be it. [MOCKING]: So be it. Just kidding. Um, simply out of curiosity, what-what exactly is this curse. What-what should I be on the lookout for. Your crops will wither in the field. Yeah, okay. Your cattle will sicken and die. Uh-huh. Your manhood will shrivel and become a useless husk. I gotta fold here, Alan. Okay, you got me. What do you say we call the girls over and start spawning baby Giglamesh. Charlie, don't do this. Hey, when she's shriveling your husk, then you get a vote. Go ahead, call the coven. [KNOCKING ON DOOR. [CHUCKLES]: Wow... you gals could make a fortune delivering pizzas. Mom. Boo, everybody. Now, not a word, Charlie. You are all coming with me to my costume party, and I'm not taking no for an answer. Evelyn. Isabella. You know each other. In a manner of speaking. What are you doing here. Nothing. These are my sons. It was an accident. I-I had... I had no idea. Please believe me. Good-bye, Isabella. Yes. Good-bye. Bye, Charlie. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on. What about the-the vows, the curse and the shriveling. I have no idea what he's talking about. What? She's in my Pilates class. Okay. I'll buy that. Now, are you coming to my party, or are you gonna give me a hard time. I'm coming to the party. ALAN: Me, too. Jake! Come get your costume. What's Mom gonna wear? Shut up. âª Men... Grandmommy doesn't want to be late to her costume party. Oh, come on, boys, sell it. Very nice. Now fly, my pets, fly. I call shotgun. [SCREAMING LAUGHTER

episode0.Episode-02-Principal Gallagher's Lesbian Loverj¦jEditor: Jk2writ. Hey, Doc, how many more adjustments do you think I'm going to need. Well, Mr. Malinkovich, let's see. Um, my son won't graduate college till 2015, so... a lot. See you next time. Okay, Mr. Dunlop. It's good to see you again, sir. And, uh, how are we doing today. Not good. I was making love to my wife last night. Oh, my God, is she okay. She's fine. She was on top. But my back went out, Doc. Okay, well, let's, uh, get you on the table and get to work. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Steady there, big fella. I took some pain pills my wife had left over from her C-section. I guess my legs are a little rubbery. How many pills did you take. Well, let's see. One when I went to bed... Mm-hmm. One when I got up... Seven. Really. You know, it's not usually a good idea to pop Class-A narcotics like Skittles. Doc, I gotta lie down. Okay, okay, but not here, n-not now. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Mr. Dunlop. Mr. Dunlop, you need to get up. Help. Fire. Big giant guy. [CELL PHONE RING TONE PLAYS "FUR ELISE". Oh, perfect. [GRUNTING. Dr. Harper speaking. Judith, this is not a good time. I'm with a patient. Well, what about Jake. Well, no, I can't pick him up at school now. W-Why can't you do it. You're not the only one under pressure, Judith. All right, I'll call Charlie and have him pick him up. Mm... Hey, hey, stop that. Stop that. [PHONE RINGING. Do you need to get it. Nah, the machine'll pick up. [TAPE CLICKING. Hey, it's Charlie. Do your thing when you hear the beep. [BEEP. ALAN: Charlie, I need your help. Oh, pick up, pick up, pick up. For God's sake. [BEEP. See. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men... . Hey, look who's here. Hi. How come you're not in school. He got sent home... For misbehaving. Well, it's about time. Hey, when I was your age, I had already been arrested twice. Charlie, don't. No convictions. Come on. I've had a really bad day. I had to cancel all my patients and close my office to go pick him up. Wow, what a drag. Hey, I got some new video games. You wanna play with me. Sure. Did you forget you're being punished. No, but why does Uncle Charlie have to suffer. Go to your room. You know, in some countries you're innocent until proven guilty. You confessed. Oh, yeah. And that country you're thinking of is this one, genius. What'd he do? Something awful. How awful. These are all multi-player games. Apparently, there is a little girl in Jake's class named Barbara Schmidt who is a little more physically developed than the other girls, and Jake decided to make a picture of her and pass it around. I only passed it to one person. What happened after that was not my responsibility. Aw, dude! Why'd you sign it. Okay, that part I regret. Go back to your room. "Boobra Schmidt.. I'm putting this one on the refrigerator. Charlie, this is serious. It really speaks to me. The girl went home in tears, her mother is on the warpath and Jake could get expelled. For a silly drawing. It's considered sexual harassment. The school has a zero-tolerance policy. Oh, for the good old days when you could wander into the girls' locker room pretending you were blind. You actually did that? That's horrible. No, the horrible part was stealing the dog from the blind kid. Well, unfortunately, times have changed and we no longer live in a Porky's movie. JAKE: What's a Porky's movie?. Close the door. I'll be in to talk with you in a minute. [DOOR CLOSES] Alan, go easy on him. He doesn't understand what he did wrong. JAKE: He's right! I don't have a clue. I thought I told you to close the door. It is closed. Go in your room. JAKE: Fine. You know what. Maybe I should talk to him. Oh. Oh, now you want to help. What's that supposed to mean. It means why didn't you pick up the phone when I needed you this afternoon. Um... I didn't want to. See? See. I can't depend on you. I never have been able to depend on you, and I never will be able to depend on you, and you know why. Because I'm undependable. Yes! Yes! Undependable and, an-and selfish, and frankly, I'm the idiot, because I deluded myself into believing that when I desperately needed my brother to go pick up my kid at school, he might actually bother to pick up the freaking phone. Okay, okay, in my defense, I really didn't want to. Okay, you're right. I'm sorry, I-I should've picked up the phone. Forget it. What's done is done. No sense grinding on it. Thank you. I just have to accept the fact that I-I can't count on anyone, least of all an emotionally immature narcissist who thinks that the sun rises out of his navel and sets in his scrotum and only cares about what lies between the two. Okay, I'm no expert, but that sounds a lot like "grinding.. I am done talking to you. Come on, Alan, I said I was sorry. Give me another chance. For what? To let me down again. Tell me what I can do. Name something. Anything. Okay, okay. I have to go to Jake's school tomorrow to see if I can keep him from being expelled. You want me to go with you? I am there. You can count on me. No, my receptionist is out sick all week and I need somebody to handle the phones while I'm gone. In your office. Yes. Way out in the Valley. Yes. All day. Yes. Gee, tomorrow's not really good for me. All right, all right, what time. The office opens at eight. O'clock. No, degrees. No reason to be snide. I just don't want to be late. Fine. We leave at seven. O'clock. âª Men. ALAN: Okay, Charlie. Time to get up and go to work. Charlie. Of course. Never even came home. Why help your only brother when you can be out boffing total strangers. "I'll be there for you.. "You can count on me.. My own fault. I'm just stupid and gullible. And annoying. Don't forget annoying. You're here. You said 7:00, right. You got yourself up. Didn't have to. Why not. Didn't sleep. You haven't been to bed. Not my bed. Hey, you want some coffee. I made some coffee. It's really good coffee. Oop, no more coffee. Why don't you make some more coffee while I go take a squirt. Morning. Yo, Berta. Berta, Bert, Bert, Bert. He just getting home. Yeah. You gotta wonder how long he can keep burnin' that pen1s at both ends. I try not to think about it. Um... Listen, Charlie is coming with me to work today. Why. He's gonna help me at the office. You want to bet. What's up with Uncle Charlie. What do you mean. He's peein' off the deck. I thought we weren't allowed to do that. We're not. We're not?. No, we're not. Okay. What's the Oompa Loompa doing here on a weekday. He got suspended from school. Why isn't he with his mother. Uh, Judith had a little liposuction yesterday and she needs to stay in bed until she... stops leaking fat. Yeah, I hate it when that happens. So what did the melonhead do. Oh, it's a long story. Ah. Worth a thousand words. Come on, Charlie. Let's go. Hang on. I'm not done yet. Oh, will you leave the seagulls alone?. For crying out loud. So... You like making fun of girls with big boobs. Not anymore. âª Men. [HUMMING "TEQUILA". [HUMMING "TEQUILA". Gridlock. [HUMMING "TEQUILA"] Stop. People do this every day. Drive to work at eight miles an hour. Pretty much. I'd have to kill myself. Oh, click. What. I just had a phenomenal business idea. They haven't perfected personal jet packs yet. Oh. Okay, I have another one. We buy a donut machine and put it in your trunk. Let's go back to the jet packs. Hear me out. The next time you're stuck in a traffic jam, you just pop your trunk Uh-huh. We'll call 'em... Gridnuts... Trunk Crullers... Stop 'n' Go-Nuts. Charlie. Yeah? Please stop talking. Okay. I got it. Trunkin' Donuts. [HUMMING "TEQUILA". [DOOR CHIMING. Here it is. The chiropractic offices of Dr. Alan Harper. Wow. So this is where you come every day, huh. Yep, for 11 years. What do you think. I would've killed myself ten and a half years ago. Okay, now, all you have to do is sit here and when the phone rings, pick it up and say, "Dr. Harper's office.. So right off the bat, I lie. I am a doctor, Charlie. Yeah, and I'm king of the traffic donuts. Moving on... I have canceled all the morning appointments, so the only thing you're going to have to deal with is walk-ins. Just have them make an appointment for another time. So I don't get to crack anybody's back. Charlie, listen to me very carefully. You must not touch the patients. This is not me talking. This is the State of California. Okay. Let me be absolutely clear. No touching the patients. Got it. What did I just say to you. Repeat it back to me. . . . . Boy, you're really not a morning person, are you. All right, I've got to go get to Jake's school. Say a prayer that I can keep him from being expelled. Don't worry about a thing. It's under control. You can count on me. Oh, if I could believe even one of those things. [PENCIL SHARPENER GRINDING. Okay, where can I hang myself. [PHONE RINGING. Hello. Oh, hey, Alan... I said "Dr. Harper's office.. I did. [PHONE RINGING. Hello. Damn, try it again. Are you waiting to see the principal. Uh, yeah. Oh, have a seat. Thank you. Uh, Alan. Oh, Mindy. Nice to meet you. You, too. Oh... um, you must be Boobra's mom... Barbara's mams... Hi. [DOOR CHIMES. Don't worry, Alan. I'm not touching the patients. There are human lives at stake here, man. I need those spines delivered immediately. Hello. Can I give you a complimentary adjustment. I'm here for the masseuse position. I see. Well, I'm really not authorized to do any hiring, but you're obviously qualified. So the hell with protocol, welcome aboard. Let me tell you something. Puberty is hard enough for a young girl without having to be leered at and made fun of by obnoxious little boys. I couldn't agree with you more. And I can assure you that I've had a long talk with Jake about how wrong it is to objectify women's... Up here. I'm up here. I know. I know. I see you. A-A-And let me tell you something. There is no one more sympathetic than I to the plight of the large-breasted woman. "Plight". It's not an affliction. Well, no, not the breasts themselves, but the attendant back problems associated with carrying the enormous load. So now my breasts are a "load". From a strictly engineering standpoint, yes. See-see, I am a chiropractor and I deal with the heartache of MMS all the time. MMS. Massive Mammary Syndrome. It's a term I coined in an article I submitted to the Journal of the American Chiropractic Association. It hasn't really caught on. Anyway, MMS is particularly acute among strippers, but they bring it on themselves with those humongous implants. Yours, on the other hand, appear quite natural. God-given, am I right. What the hell is wrong with you. I don't know. I was a bottle baby. I'm sorry, Dr. Harper's not in this morning, but if your back's really bothering you, we do have a masseuse on duty. Fine. Anything. Well, let's see, she just went in with a patient about five minutes ago, so if you don't mind waiting. Thank you, that was great. Good. Come back soon. Soon. I'll be back after lunch. You next? Oh, please. Let's go. What's this. Your cut. Click. I'm really sorry. Just drop it. You know, in my defense... well, in defense of all men, we do live in a mammo-centric society. Mammo-centric. Another coinage of mine. Hasn't really permeated the cultural zeitgeist. Hey, bottle baby. I'm up here. That-that perfectly illustrates my points... point. From the moment we are born, we are basically bombarded by breasts. Breasts in advertising, breasts in television, breasts in movies. Here a breast, there a breast, everywhere a breast, breast... Heck, you can understand the fixation. You're a horrible little man. Okay, okay, I had hoped that we could have a spirited exchange of ideas here, but if we're going to just degenerate into name-calling, perhaps we should wait for the principal to decide what a reasonable punishment for my son would be. Fine. We'll let the principal decide. Okay. I'm Principal Gallagher. Oh, God, my boy's gonna get the chair. Time. Man, is this day ever gonna end. Hey, Alan. What's going on here. I had another business idea. You what. Hear me out. What do men like better than donuts. Hang on. Time. âª Men. 4,200, 4,300, 4,301, 4,302. I hate singles. Don't you hate singles. You turned my business into a brothel. I thought you'd be proud of me. I didn't touch a single patient. I left you alone for a couple of hours and you turned my business into a brothel. You know what you need. A nice, relaxing massage. Oh, shut up. There is a happy ending here. From what I saw, there was, like, 40 of 'em. And that's just what's on the books. I don't want to know about it. I never want to know about it. Okay, we'll change the subject. Thank you. How'd it go at Jake's school. I don't want to talk about it. I never want to talk about it. You screwed up, huh. In ways you can't imagine. So he's expelled. No, he's just suspended for the week. That's not so bad. It's already Wednesday. I, on the other hand, have been asked never to set foot on the grounds of Woodward Avenue Elementary School again. No kidding. And it was strongly suggested that I resign from the PTA. Whoa. And there was talk of a civil suit. Oh, and Principal Gallagher's lesbian lover might just drop by tonight to kick my ass. Remind me to charge the camcorder. Oh, click. Another great business idea. I don't want to hear it. Just listen. We put a massage table in the trunk of your car... Forget it, Charlie. Actually, we'd probably need a van... I'm not listening. Oh, come on. Who needs their tension relieved more than guys stuck in traffic. We'll call it... Bumper to Humper... Speed Humps... I got it. Jiffy Lube. Oh, wait, somebody already has that

showTwo-And-Half-MenjmEditor: Jk2writ. [SUCKING THROUGH TEETH. [SUCKING CONTINUES. Will you please stop that?. I got a piece of popcorn stuck in my teeth. So go brush them. I brushed them this morning. So go floss them. Oh, gross. [SUCKS THROUGH TEETH. Wait. I got it. No, that's chicken. When did we have chicken. You didn't really brush this morning, did you. Between you and me, I lost my toothbrush three days ago. Still good. Hey, have you met any of the ladies my dad's been dating. No. You. No. More chicken. Fingernail. Yours. I hope so. So, how come I don't get to meet Dad's dates. I don't know. Maybe 'cause you're disgusting. No, come on, really. I'm not kidding. For most women, you're a deal-breaker. But you used to say I was a babe magnet. You used to be little and cute. Now you're just old and in the way. That's very hurtful, Uncle Charlie. All right, the truth is that your dad doesn't want you to get attached to any of these women in case the relationship doesn't work out. Why. Because he loves you very much, and he cares about your feelings. You let me meet your dates. And what does that tell you. I have no idea. âª Men, men, men, men, manly, men, men, men . âª Oh, oh âª Men... . ALAN: Hello. Hey, Dad. What are you doing up so late. Charlie, what is he doing up. Shh, he's asleep. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Charlie. What?. Oh, hey, Alan. What is he doing up so late. I told him to go to bed. How many times did I tell you to go to bed? Boy, I lost count. See. So how was your date. It was fine. Did you get any. Did I get any what. Hang on. What's he supposed to get. I swear, I don't know what he's talking about. Go to bed. What are you teaching him. What difference does it make. The only thing he retains is little shards of chicken. Wonderful. So, did you get any. It was a nice evening. We had a lovely dinner. You know, for the record, "a lovely dinner" doesn't necessarily preclude carpet burns and a bite mark on your ass. In this case, it was just dinner and pleasant conversation. Well, that's why God gave us Cinemax and an opposable thumb. Good night. Oh, hey, Alan. The kid was asking about these women you've been going out with, why he never gets to meet any of them. Really? Uh, what... what did you tell him. I said it's probably because he's disgusting. Oh, Charlie... I also told him that you love him and that you don't want him to get attached to somebody and then be disappointed if things don't work out. Good. Thank you. But how come I don't get to meet them. 'Cause you're disgusting. That's very hurtful, Alan. Come on, really. What's the big secret with these women. Oh, boy, I-I really don't want to get into it. They're hideous, right? No. Insufferable? No. Inflatable. Are you insane. Ooh, insane. Are they insane. Leave me alone. Come on, give me a hint. When you go to pick them up, do you need a border collie to cut them off from the herd. Stop it. I'm never going to stop, Alan. You know me better than that. Okay, fine. I'll-I'll tell you. First of all, there's no women. Imaginary. My next guess was gonna be imaginary. Let me finish. It's just one woman. I've been seeing the same woman for several weeks now. I see. You've been playing it slow. Yes. And by "slow," I mean "gay.. I can't talk to you about this. Alan, you hook a fish and play it too long, you know what you're gonna finally have when you reel it in? What. A tired fish that thinks you're gay. Do you drink while you're baby-sitting my son. Not at first, but he wears me down. So, what's the deal with this broad. She's not a broad. [SIGHS. It's Judith. Your ex-wife. Yep. Okay. Okay, that's not fair. You said "no" to insufferable and insane. Very funny. Are you serious. And by "serious," I mean dumber than a bag of doorknobs. Look, we went out to dinner a couple of weeks ago to talk about getting Jake into a good middle school, and before you know it, we were laughing and... and having a great time. Well, I can see the humor in trying to get the little bonehead into a good school. But that doesn't mean you start dating your ex-wife. I-I know what you're thinking. I'm being naive, and romantic, and... Not even close. Charlie, you can't overlook the fact that we still have a lot in common. Yeah, neither of you have any respect for you. The point is, she wants to give it another try, and so do I. But we can't let Jake know because we don't want him to get his hopes up. Oh, buddy, why don't you just take an electric sander to your testicles. We're both adults, we are aware of the pitfalls, and we think it's worth the risk. [SIGHS. Okay, fine. I wish you both nothing but happiness. Thank you. [MIMICS ELECTRIC SANDER. âª Men... . Hello. ALL: Hello. What's going on. Sit down, Alan. We need to talk. Yeah, well, uh... listen, I'd love to, but I've got to wake up Jake so that we can... Let him sleep. Am I getting whacked. It was discussed, but I was overruled. Sit down. Alan, we're all here because we love you. And we don't want to see you make a terrible mistake. I'm just waiting for my toaster strudel to pop. [TOASTER DINGS. There we go. You told on me. Hey, you wouldn't listen to reason, so now you're going to listen to Mom. Alan, sweetheart, you know I only want the best for you, right. Uh... I do. I do. Which is why, when Judith threw you out, I was right there supporting you. You had other options. Don't be naive. I could have sucked up to Judith in order to have more access to my grandson. But, no, I burned that bridge. I said horrible things to her that I can never take back. And, keep in mind, this is a woman who worked the phrase "mousy bitch" into her wedding toast. So, if you two reconcile, I'll have to apologize to her. So. I'd rather kill us all. Okay. Moving on. Rose, do you have something you'd like to say to Alan. Yes, thank you. Alan, when I first met you, I didn't care for you at all. You were a fussy, whiny control freak. Yes, and-and now. Oh. Now it doesn't bother me so much. CHARLIE: I think what Rose means is that, since the divorce, you've grown, you've been reborn. ROSE: That's not what I meant. If that was what I meant, that's what I would've said. Sorry. Yeah, you'll get your turn. Okay. Alan, life is all about moving on. Now, in the animal kingdom, sharks move forward while crabs move sideways. So the question you have to ask yourself is, are you a shark or a crab. Which way do sea monkeys move. [DOORBELL RINGS. Okay, that's Judith. Now, I thank you for your concern, but, uh, I would appreciate it if nobody said anything and everybody just stayed out of it. [CHUCKLES]: Yeah, right. Hey, Mom. Hi, honey. Why aren't you dressed. Alan, I told you I was picking him up early. Why isn't he ready. Go get dressed. I'm sorry. Yeah, you're always sorry, but I'm always the one who has to play the bad guy. Damn it, Alan... Okay, he's gone. I was thinking about you last night. Really? What were you thinking. Just what a nice time I had. Yes, yes, it was. Alan. Uh-huh. Turn around. ALL: Hi, Judith. Hello. How are you. ALL: Fine. Bye, everybody. ALL: Bye, Jake. Bye-bye. ALL: Good-bye. Thanks for staying out of it. ALL: You're welcome. âª Men... âª I got a surprise for you. ALAN: Can it wait. Jake forgot his math book. I'm going to run it over to Judith's. No, no, no, no, no, you can't go to Judith's. The surprise is ready now. Okay. What is it. Ta-da. Oh, for God's sake. Wait, there's more. Twins, Alan. I got 'em for you, but you can share if you want. Charlie, no. Fine, you can have them both. Bad luck to split sisters anyway. I don't want either of 'em. I'm going over to Judith's. I don't think you're getting the full picture here. Turn around. Show him the full picture. Huh? Huh. That's daily Pilates classes and one meal a month. I'll see you later. Are you sure. Even put together, these girls aren't as old as your ex-wife. Bye. Oh, for the love of God. Stop turning. Show's over. [WHISPERING]: Isn't he adorable. ALAN: Yeah. When's he's sleeping, he's like a little angel. Uh-huh. [BREAKS WIND. I was planning to have a glass of wine and sit in the hot tub before you came over. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I just wanted to be sure he got the book. I'll get out of your way. Alan, would you like to join me. Oh, well, uh, I didn't bring a bathing suit. You don't need a bathing suit. Okay. Have you been keeping up the chlorine treatments. 'Cause, you know, without a bathing suit, you're just inviting algae into your privates. I like the, uh... the new patio furniture. Thanks. What is that, uh, uh, redwood. Teak. Whoa, teak. That must have set me back a few bucks. The salesman said it would pay for itself in five years. Oh, really? Really. How-how's it going to do that. Is it going to get a paper route. It's very nice. Thank you. Uh, of course, it's, uh, going to require a lot of upkeep. Um, actually, all wood that's outside requires upkeep... except trees. They seem to have it down. Alan, are you nervous. Yeah, a-a little. I mean, uh... we've been separated for two years. I haven't seen you naked for four... except, you know, that-that one time I walked in on you on the toilet, um... Shh... . . . . JAKE: Mom, you out there. [WHISPERING]: Oh, my God, what are we going to do?. Take a deep breath. What. I'm thirsty. Uh, so have something to drink. There's no more Goofy Juice. So have some water. Fine. [GASPING. Hey, Mom. What?. I'm hungry, too. Can you make me a sandwich. No. Have your drink and go to bed. Fine. [GASPING. JAKE: Mom. How about a cookie. Uh, you already brushed your teeth. No, I didn't. You said you did. I always say that. Well, then brush them and go to bed. Fine. [GASPING. Are you okay. There was a bright light, and I saw my dead grandma. She seemed happy. Here, have a little wine. Thank you. Thank you. That was close. Oh, relax, he... he didn't see you. And what if he comes back. Maybe I should go. Or we could go upstairs and get in bed. Bed? Our old bed. My new bed. Oh. What was wrong with the old one. Too many memories. Of what? You pretending to sleep and me watching Letterman. Alan, do you really want to have this conversation. No, I don't, but apparently my mouth has a mind of its own. Well, let's put your mouth to better use. I can't go back underwater, Judith. Hey, Charlie. Yeah. Not that it's any of my business, but I couldn't help noticing the matched set of rotating floozies on your deck earlier. They were for Alan. I was trying to get his mind off of Judith. With a night of meaningless, impersonal group s*x. What a good brother. No, no. A good brother gets him a couple of girls. It takes a great brother to get him two from the same egg. You know... there is a possibility that we were wrong about this. Maybe Alan and Judith can work things out. Maybe, but if they do, what happens to Jake. He grows up in a happy home with a mommy and daddy who love each other. Yeah, but what about me. It's too late for you, Charlie. No, I mean, what happens to me and Jake. I'll never get to see him. Aw, you really love the little guy, huh. Yeah, I guess I do. Love hurts, Rose. Yes, it does. Especially when you've given your heart to someone who barely knows you exist, who insists on plowing through strange, stupid women who could never love him the way you do, leaving you to stand outside, alone in the night, wishing with all your heart that he would come to his senses and realize that his true happiness lies with you and no one else, but knowing all the while that it'll never happen because he's a selfish, immature, heartless jerk. I mean... poor baby. Okay, I'm going to stick my neck out here and say that was the best s*x we ever had. I agree. Not that it wasn't good before... It wasn't. Okay. Granted. Which raises the question... Why is it so much better now. Does it matter. No, not-not really. I mean, just-just curious. I mean, I, uh... I noticed, uh, some new moves on your part, and I can't help wondering where you might have picked them up. Are you saying you haven't been with other women in the last two years. Oh, no, no, I-I've been with other women. I just didn't learn anything. You, on the other hand, have an entirely new sexual repertoire, including a-a couple of numbers I repeatedly requested when we were married. Alan... And by "requested," I mean "begged.. Please don't go there. Oh. Now, see, that's, uh... that's what I'm used to hearing from you in bed. "Don't go there.. "Ooh, don't touch that.. "Leave that alone. It's not a toy.. So I've changed. I would think that you would be happy. Well, I was... very happy, but then I started to think about it, and there's no reason you couldn't have changed with me. Oh, please. I mean, I gave you every chance. I-I bought tickets to s*x seminars. I-I brought home books and tapes and accessories, and-and-and what happened. I sat right here reading and watching by myself while eating low-fat love jelly straight out of the tube. Okay, I can see this was a bad idea. No, no. The bad idea was sitting in that filthy hot tub without a bathing suit. I can feel mushrooms growing in my crack as we speak. Just go home, Alan. Hey, we're not married anymore. You can't tell me what to do. JAKE: Hey, Mom, does this look infected. Okay, bye. [BUSHES RUSTLING. It's okay. I didn't see anything. âª Men... . [DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING. Hey. Hey. What are you watching. Soft-core p0rn. Sound's not on. I don't need to hear 'em. Aren't those the-the twins from the deck. Too late now, Alan. You could have been delivering that pizza. So, how's Judith. Fine. She got some new patio furniture. That's nice. Teak. Put in some rosebushes, too. How about that. And I think the neighbors got a new dog. Huh. A mean dog. Really. Might have been a coyote. Mm-hmm. Hard to say. It was dark, and I was crying. Anything else. No. Oh, yeah, um... I saw our dead grandmother. Where. In the hot tub. [CAR HORN HONKS. Oh, that's the cab. Ooh, could you, uh, lend me 60 bucks. Uh, I don't have my wallet on me. Sure. Oh. Thank you. Huh. I suddenly have a craving for pizza

episode'%Episode-22-Just Once with Aunt Sophiej¸uEditor: Jk2writ. Hey. Hey. So, what's going on in school. Nothing. Nothing? You just sit there all day and stare at the wall. That's where the clock is. [PHONERINGS. CHARLIE: I got it. Well, I find it hard to believe that you just watch the clock all day. Have you seen my report card. Jake, it's for you. I'm busy. It's a girl. I don't care. Her name is Wendy Cho. Hold on! I'm coming! Don't hang up. Hey. How's it going. Okay, that's something we haven't seen before. Yeah. He only moves that fast when he's got the squirts. Wendy Cho is the smartest girl at school. I wonder why she's calling Jake. Maybe she lost a bet. That's not nice. Well, kids are cruel. Jake is obviously smitten with her. I just hope he's not setting himself up for disappointment. Hey, you know what they say. "A man's reach must exceed his grasp or what's a pen1s for?. Who says that. Okay, I might be paraphrasing. âª Men, men, men, men, manly, men, men, men . âª Oh. âª Men... Hey, Dad? Yeah, Jake. Wendy Cho's having a party tomorrow night. Can I go. Tomorrow? A little last minute, isn't it. Well, she wasn't going to invite m. 'cause Danny Palmer told Amy Sherlack that I didn't like her, but I told Peter Calahan to tell Ellen Meisner that I kinda did. I see. You do. He lost me at Amy Sherlack. Are her parents going to be there. I guess. Let the fathers who have girls worry about that. Shut up. All right. I'm going to want to meet her parents, but I don't see any reason why you can't go. Cool. Oh, yeah. I'm going a new shirt, new pants and new shoes. What's wrong with those you've got. Are you kidding? Everybody's already seen them. Yeah, but not with all the latest food stains. I hear gravy's the new black. Fine. We'll go shopping tomorrow. How about a new haircut. What's wrong with my hair. Let's just say everybody's already seen it. Okay. New haircut. So, this is your first party with girls, huh. Maybe. Maybe? You're not sure. You got some cross-dressers in sixth grade. Playing a little pin the tail on the tranny. Shut up. Why does everyone keep telling me to shut up. 'Cause you're an insensitive dolt. That's no reason. This is a very delicate time in a boy's life. I remember how nervous I was about my first boy-girl party. Oh, right. That was in college, wasn't it. Shut up. What's important now is that we support Jake. Agreed. I'll kick in the wine coolers and a package of condoms. What are you going to do. You're joking, right. Okay, let's say I'm joking. Look, I appreciate your interest but this is a father-son moment and, in fact, it's one that I've been looking forward to since I saw the shadow of his little dingus in the first sonogram. That's very touching, and more than a bit creepy. But, still, I can't risk letting you scar the kid forever. What do you mean by that. Face it, Alan. What can you bring to the table other than a lifetime of abject failure with women. It's not a lifetime yet. I, on the other hand, have a wealth of experience to offer. He's 12. He doesn't need to know how to choreograph a three-way. I'm not talking about that. I'm saving that for prom night. Oh, good. Let me give you an example. Jake's at the party. All the boys are on one side of the room, all the girls are on the other. What's he do. Um... You see? You see. Right there... that "um..."... Is the battle cry of the chronic masturbator. Define "chronic.. The solution to the problem, my hairy-palmed friend... ...is to walk right up to the prettiest girl there and ask her to dance. Why the prettiest girl. Because she's the one all the other guys are afraid of. She'll be dying for some attention. What if Wendy Cho isn't the prettiest girl at the party. It doesn't matter. When she sees our boy dancing with a hot chick, she'll be all over him. Of course. It's... it's so obvious. Bet you're wishing you could do over sixth grade now, huh. I could have danced with Heidi Winkler. Yeah, you could have. Or... or Pam Talega. Yep. Or Mary Beth Hicks. Uh-huh. Shoshana Wasserstein. Ooh. I don't think so. âª Men... Hey, can I get leather pants. No. No. Why not. Because you need something that lets the farts out. So... Wendy Cho, huh. Real subtle, Alan. Charlie, it's a father-son thing. Yeah, so was prewar Iraq. You, uh, want to tell me about her. Not really. Is she in your class. Where else would I meet her, in a bar. My turn? No. I'm just curious about what kind of person she is, what is about her that you find... I don't know... alluring. What. Your dad wants to know if you think she's hot. Oh. It's personal. She's hot. Are you nervous about this party. I don't know, maybe a little. Okay, Jake, here's what you do. Charlie. Hey, hey, you had your shot. "Alluring". Is there going to be dancing tonight. I think so. Terrific. Do you know how to dance. Not exactly. Don't worry; it's easy to fake. The thing to remember is the more you move your arms, the stupider you look. Oh, that is so not true. Just keep it simple, and you'll be fine. Okay. Besides, the critical time is between dances. What do you mean. That's when you talk, or more precisely, you get her to talk. About what. Doesn't matter... You won't be listening anyway. Oh, Charlie. Just drive the car. Yeah, Dad, this is important. Keep in mind: you're not looking to score tonight, you're just trying to get into the batter's box. Wendy doesn't like sports. You're missing the point. She plays violin. Listen to me. Your goal for the party tonight is to convince Wendy Cho that you're a mature, sophisticated guy who sees her not just as a woman but as a complete human being. You got it. I think so. Good. I'm not going. Hey, hey, not only are you going to go, but it's going to be a night you'll remember for the rest of your life. That's what I'm afraid of. âª Men... Oh, oh, this is nice. Yeah, sure, if he's doing the other kids' taxes. It's a timeless style. No, it just seems timeless when you're not getting laid. Put it back. JAKE: This is cool. CHARLIE: Yeah, just one question: is your Wendy Cho a voodoo priestess. No, I think she's Chinese. Put it back. You know, there's something to be said for letting him make his own choices here. Oh, that's a bunch of crap... he's an idiot. If we let him, he'd go to that party in a Viking helmet and a cape. Ah. Here we go. Don't even think about it. What? It says, "I've got a little money, but I'm not a corporate drone.. No, it says, "I'm pushing 40, and I can't deal with it.. All right. Maybe the kid needs his own look. Jake, come here. What? CHARLIE: Just stand there. Let's try and visualize what your personal style might be. Okay. Maybe we should start with the haircut. âª Men... Oh, my, has Mommy been trimming your hair with her teeth. What. Not to worry, Ricky loves a challenge. I'm guessing Ricky also loves pretending he's a taffy apple. You want to take him to your guy, with the shaking hands and the signed picture of Desi Arnaz on the wall. Desi Arnaz had beautiful hair. So, Charles, do we have a game plan, or shall I just follow my muse. Can I get a mohawk. No. No. No. I think we should just go for something young and hip. Like your hairstyle. Sure. Why not. You'd have to kill me. Just tighten it up a little, nothing extreme. Can you make it purple. No. No. No. Aw, man. Relax, Jake, Ricky knows what he's doing. He's been cutting my hair for years. Well, what if I don't want to look like you. What's wrong with the way I look. Nothing... if you're a statue in front of a Big Boy restaurant. Are you freakin' kidding me. Charlie. Kid should be so lucky. We'll wait over here. I'm buying the little wiseass a $75 haircut, and he's taking shots at me. You said it yourself: he has to find his own look. Yeah, well, let him find it on somebody else's MasterCard. Look at his point of view. What's his point of view. Well, put overalls on you, and you do kind of look like the Big Boy. Stand like this for me. Shut up. By the way... did you have "the talk" with him. Oh, sure, I mean, well, we've had a talk, you know, covered the basics. He knows where babies come from and how they got there. That's all? He's going to this party completely clueless about how much fun he can have between "Hi, how are you?. And "What do you mean you missed your period?. Charlie, it's a kids' party: pizza, soft drinks, a little dancing. Oh, really? You know what I was doing at his age. I don't want to hear it. Are you sure. It involves Shoshana Wasserstein. You danced with Shoshana Wasserstein. Actually, that's the one thing we didn't do. Nevertheless, I am Jake's father, and I happen to believe childhood should be a time of innocence. I agree... childhood should be a time of innocence. And Bambi's mother shouldn't die, and lap dances should be complimentary after the fifth cocktail. But that's not the world we live in. This party tonight is the initial round in a lifelong process of sexual elimination. Oh, really. Think of it as musical chairs, but when the music stops, the guys who have a clue are sitting on a woman instead of a chair. The guys who have no clue, they'll spend their teenage years... Well, I certainly don't need to tell Dungeonmaster Alan. âª Men... I'm ready. It's very nice. Yeah, I think we're good. Turn around. You're supposed to take the price tag off. But you said it was good to be seen in expensive clothes. You still want him to learn from his mistakes. Fine. Can we go now? Hang on. Let's see the dance moves. [CHARLIE SINGING MID-TEMPO DANCE BEAT. Don't stare at your shoes. Eyes on the girl at all times. Pretend you care. [CHARLIE SINGING. Good, good, good. Now, how do you stand when you know Wendy's looking at you. That's it. Little head bob. Show me the sleepy eyes. I said sleepy, not brain-dead. All right. Who's the man. I'm the man. Who's the man. I'm the man. Okay, let's go get 'em. [SINGING DANCE BEAT. CHARLIE [CALLS ]: Alan! I'm coming. 2138... 2136... Try the house with the balloons tied to the mailbox. Oh. Right. Okay. Let's go. Where are you going. I want to meet her parents, say hello, find out when to pick you up. Alan, you take one step out of this car, I will beat your brains out with a tire iron. Thank you, Uncle Charlie. Have fun. Uh, call my cell when you want me to pick you... [DOOR CLOSES. ...up. [SIGHS]: There he goes. My son is attending his first boy-girl party. [BOTH SIGH LOUDLY. . . . . Who's that opening the door. Oh, that's, uh, that's Wendy Cho. Oh, good. She's cute. The kid's got taste. But she's, like, a foot taller than him. That's all right... When they slow dance, his head'll be perfectly positioned. Oh, get your mind out of the gutter. Right. Like, you never copped a feel with your ear. No. Well... okay, once, with Aunt Sophie. But that was an accident. So you know what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah. âª Men... Here you go. Thank you. [LAUGHS]: Oh, looks good. She's pretty, huh. Huh. Yeah, I guess. What's the matter with you. What if I sent him out there too soon. What if he's not ready. Don't beat yourself up. You did everything you could. There just wasn't enough time, damn it. It's out of our hands... We just have to let nature take its course. Sounds good... unfortunately, nature keeps telling him to scratch his ass. [PHONE PLAYS RING-TONE. Oh, it's Jake. Oh, God, I knew it! Give me that. No, no, no, I got it. Hey, what's up, buddy. He wants to come home. Why? He just got there. Why? You just got there. He says it's personal. Give me that. Jake... Jake, I'm gonna talk you through this. Just pipe down and listen. Finish your cookie later. Where's Wendy Cho right now. Well, how many girls is she talking to. Okay, okay, you got to split her from the herd. Walk over and say you have something to ask her. Then take her hand and lead her away from her friends. Okay, then put the cookie down first. Now, when you have some privacy, I want you to look her right in the eye and say you were lying, you just wanted to be alone with her. It will, too, work. All right, call me back. [SIGHS. God, I just wish I could be there with him. Me, too. Thanks. You ready for a refill. Sure. Are you okay. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just worried about my nephew. He's at his first boy-girl party. Aw, that's adorable. Uh, he's, uh, he's my son. Uh-huh. How old is he. 12. Kid's the apple of my eye. You're so sweet. Uh, excuse me, officially, it's, uh, my apple, uh, and my eye. Okay. Connie. Charlie. Would you like some pie, Charlie. It's on the house. Your house or mine. [LAUGHS]: You're awful. Mine. Un-freakin'-believable. Look, Connie, I'm kind of tied up tonight, you know, with my nephew, but why don't you write your number on the bill? Hmm. Already did. What. He's my son. But I know how to use him. [PHONE PLAYS "FUR ELISE" RING TONE. Oh, it's Jake. Talk to me. No, you're the man. You're the man. Great. Keep me posted. Who's the man. Right. What? What. It's going well. âª Men... He's gonna be one of the last to leave. That's a good sign. [SIGHS]: Yeah. You tend to lose track of time when you're in a closet with a girl. Uh-huh. I just wish I could've covered kissing with him. Please, God, don't let him pucker. [HEAVY SIGH] What's wrong. Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry, Wendy'll know what to do. She's probably been practicing with her girlfriends. Man, chicks are so lucky. It's not the kissing, it's... [SIGHS. It's this whole thing. Hey, look, I'm sorry if I interfered with the father-son deal, Alan... No, no, no, you've, uh, you've done a great job. Jake's really lucky to have you. So what's the problem. I guess I'm a little jealous. Of what. Charlie, do you have any idea what it would've meant to me to have you take me under your wing the way you have with Jake. Oh, we're we go. Dad was gone and there was no one to teach me this stuff. You know how I found out about French kissing. Mom sliced a plum in half and stuck her tongue in it. Aw, you could've taken that secret to the grave. And that's not all she showed me. To this day I can't eat plums, dried apricots or b-bananas. All right, all right, I'm sorry. Look, I was young, I was selfish. I should've been there for you. You know, it's not too late. That's a real nice idea, buddy. But I'm afraid it is. JAKE: Hey. Hey. Well? How'd it go. Okay. J-Just okay? Alan, leave it alone. All right. So, Jake, congratulations. For what. You got lipstick all over your mouth. Aw, man. Relax, I was bluffing. Oh. But congratulations. Thanks. âª Men... but I think Jake's off to a good start with the ladies. Yeah, listen, Charlie, um, don't take this the wrong way, but... I really don't want Jake to grow up like... you. Oh, Alan, how could I possibly take that the wrong way. No, I mean, I don't want him to be a player. I want him to value women and cherish his relationships with them. Hey, I value women. I cherish my relationships with them. But I take your point. Hey, Dad, how old do you have to be to get married. Uh, I guess 18. Why. Just wondering how long Wendy and I have to wait. One kiss, and he's ready to marry the girl. So. So you don't have to worry. He's definitely your son

season	Season-03jérEditor: Jk2writ. You're up early. Well, it's a beautiful day, shame to waste it sleeping. Must have got to bed early then. I guess. Well, you know what they say. Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man, healthy, wealthy and can't get laid, huh. Maybe I'm not trying. Yeah. And look for me next month on the cover of Maxim. I'll have nothing on but the vacuum. Hey, you're up early. Yes, Alan, I'm up early. I went to bed early and I slept alone. Anything else you want to know. Was I this cranky when I wasn't having s*x. Nah, you were more of a sullen whiner. Okay, Huggy Bear, I gotta go. All right, Kandi. Have a good day. Yo, Daisy Mae. Just out of curiosity, when you leave here, where is it you go. To the gym. I have to take care of my body 'cause it's my instrument. Mine, too. Three beers and a bratwurst and my ass turns into a French horn. Really. Whenever I have beer and bratwurst, I just fart a lot. Okay, okay, Kandi, well, I'll see you tonight. Bye, everybody. Congratulations, Alan. It looks like you've officially boinked her brains out. Okay, so she's not overly sophisticated. Sophisticated. She's two marbles rolling around in a tin can. Hey, she's got a great heart, she's warm and loving and she genuinely cares for me. I stand corrected. One marble. Look, buddy, I'm happy you finally found an instrument to play that isn't in your own pants... but she's been spending a lot of time here and if you're not careful, pretty soon she's gonna want to move in. Would that be so bad. Hey, I don't have a lot of rules around here, but nine of the top ten are just different ways of saying "women are not allowed to live here.. They come and they go. Often they do one of those things multiple times, but in the end, they always go. But why is that so important. Alan, there's a natural balance in this house which must not be upset. It's like the Amazon rain forest. Bring in one too many spider monkeys and before you know it you're up to your ass in tree frogs. Oh, tree frogs. That clears everything up. Don't patronize me, you hump-happy simpleton. You know what I'm saying. I do... you're saying that if Kandi were to move in here it would be an environmental disaster of epic proportions. Exactly. So I guess now would be a bad time to tell you that she's been living here the past three weeks. What. Who's the simpleton now. Kandi got evicted from her apartment three weeks ago and she moved in here. Oh, please, if a woman was living in my own house for that long I think I'd notice. Oh, really? Really. Well, uh, let's try a little experiment. What color is the couch in the living room. The couch. Ah-ah. No peeking. What color is it. Well, it's, uh, kind of a... beige-ish... Tan. You sure. Yeah, I'm sure. Go look. Fine. What the hell is that. Your couch. Jake spilled grape juice on it last summer and I had it re-upholstered. Last summer. Yeah, it was gone almost a month. Berta and I had a bet on how long it would take you to notice. I had 50 bucks on never. All right, this is unacceptable. This is my house and if furniture's gonna get re-upholstered or moved or changed in any way whatsoever, I demand to be consulted. Okay, from now on. I promise. Thank you. I bought the damn thing. You'd think I'd have a vote. Maybe show me a swatch. Hey, wait a minute. Did somebody say Kandi's living here. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª âª Oo. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men âª âª Ooh âª Oo. âª Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ah. âª Men. âª Men. Boy, am I thirsty. That's 'cause you sweat so much during s*x. Hey, I may not have the biggest boat in the marina, but nobody rows harder than me. You have a boat. No, sweetie, what I meant was... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Some of us don't want to hear about your little dinghy. Oh, hi, Charlie. What're you doing here. You know, I was asking myself the same thing, so I did a little research and it turns out, it's my house. Yeah, but I thought you were going out. I did go out. And then I came back. Alone. No, Alan, I brought home an invisible cocktail waitress. She's doing me even as we speak. You're right. There's no way you could've been that cranky. You want some company, Charlie. Alan can't have s*x again for at least 30 minutes. That's a rough estimate. Thanks, but I'd really rather be alone. Okeydoke. Come on, I think he wants to m*st*rb*t*. Not for at least 30 minutes. âª Men . Okay, I haven't sampled anything from the other side of the buffet since I traveled with the Grateful Dead, but golly Moses, she's a muffin. Interesting turn of events, huh. Your brother hitting one of your hand-me-downs, and the way things are going, you couldn't get laid if you painted your pen1s to look like money. Don't think I haven't tried. I'm reminded of the tale of the tortoise and the hare. Isn't there something you could be doing. Well, I could rub some oil on her, but I don't trust myself. Berta, please don't take this the wrong way, but it's been a long time for me, and you're starting to turn me on. I'm out of here. KANDI: Hi, Berta. BERTA: Hey, baby. Hi, Charlie. Hi. Boy, this is weird, huh. In so many ways. But which one caught your attention. Well, I've never slept with brothers before. I mean, at different times. And one can't help but make comparisons. No kidding. So how big a difference are we talking about. It's huge. Really. Oh, yeah. With you, s*x was kind of like going on Space Mountain. It's a good ride, but there's never any real danger. With Alan, it's like being in the back seat of a car driven by a really smart kangaroo. He may go up on the curb a couple of times, but he'll get you there. Okay, thanks for clearing that up. [DOORBELL CHIMES] I'll get it. There's a two-hour wait for Space Mountain. Hi, Mrs. Harper. Oh, dear Lord. Hey, Kandi, I got Evil Dead 3 for Xbox. Sweet. Kandi, maybe you'd like to go put some clothes on. Why. Yeah, she ain't hurting anybody. I just don't think that outfit is appropriate for Jake. Oh, I agree. He would look ridiculous in this. Can you get Alan for me. He's not back from work yet. He's not? Then what are you doing here. I live here now. Didn't Alan tell you. No, he did not. Charlie, I want to talk to you. Good to know. Charlie, get over here. [GROANS. It was nice seeing you, Mrs. Harper. What in God's name does she see in him. Well, I don't have all the details, Mrs. Harper, but apparently when he's not being emasculated and demoralized on a daily basis, he's quite the lover. What's that supposed to mean. You know what they say. Your average man's like a good field mule. If you don't beat him, he'll keep plowing all day long. Nobody says that. You're hard to fool. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm tired of talking to you. âª Men . I had an interesting chat with your ex-wife today. Oh, can't we just have a nice dinner. I like her. [CONTEMPTUOUSLY]: Why. [PLEASANTLY]: Uh... why. Well, unlike most ex-wives I've known, she's never tried to run me over with her car. Okay, new dinner conversation. Jake, how was school. I don't think this conversation will make you any happier, Dad. What now. We had a surprise test today. And. I was really surprised. So, in other words, you weren't prepared. You can't prepare for a surprise, Dad. New conversation. Jake, what are we gonna do. You've really fallen behind this year. I know. I think it's a delayed reaction to your divorce. Oh. Yeah, it took a while, but my teachers have finally stopped feeling sorry for me. You know, I'm a child of divorce, too, Jake. Really. How old were you when your parents split up. Twenty-two. But you're 22 now. 22 and a half. Boy, what I'd give to be 22 again. New subject. No. No more conversation. Jake, if you're finished, just go do your homework. I'm gonna need help. You don't need help, you need to focus. I'll help you, Jake. Do you know anything about geometry. Well, I know it's what you say when you turn into a tree. Get it. Gee, I'm a tree. Good one. Boy, I hope when they get to Oz the wizard has two brains to give out. And speaking of out, when's Kandi leaving. You don't have to worry. Because. I have a plan. Alan, if history has taught us anything, it's that both those statements cannot be true. It's very simple. You give a man a fish, he eats for a day. You teach him to fish, he eats forever. Okay, okay, in that example is Kandi the man or the fish. I found her a job. Within a few weeks she'll be able to afford her own place and she won't have to depend on me anymore. Where is she working. Uh, she's going to be our receptionist. That's your plan. Why, it's... it's... brilliant. What? She's attractive, she's friendly, she's more than capable of answering the phones. Alan, you ever hear the expressio. "don't crap where you eat". Well, you, my friend, are dropping plunkies all over the dessert cart. Okay, you have a better solution. No, no, no, no. It's your girlfriend, your office, your life. Screw it up however you think best. [PHONE RINGING. I'll get it. I'm expecting a call. Hello. [PHONE RINGING. Kandi, that's... that's the TV remote. Oh, duh. Hello. [PHONE RINGING. Hello. Have you thought of teaching a fish to answer the phones. Hello. Staying in tonight. Yep. Giving up on the ladies, huh? Yep. Not even going to try? Nope. You know, I got a niece in the joint. She doesn't look like much, but she does get conjugal visits. I don't think so. Hold on, I may have a copy of her mug shot. Here. She looks a little wall-eyed, but that's only because they had to use the taser to get her out of the shed. The shed. She was running a meth lab. But you've got to admit, she's nice and slender. Thanks, but pass. Think about it. Visiting days are Wednesdays and Fridays. But if you decide to go, be a sport... take her a pie. Right. Make is something chewy. The prison dentist set her up with some real nice teeth. âª Men . Okay, now this isn't my lamp. What happened to my lamp. Unless this is my lamp. Yeah, this is my lamp. I bought this lamp to go with my couch. My tan couch. Worst day of my life. Yeah, well, it was no picnic for me either. I don't even know who you are anymore. Oh, you want to know who I am. I'm the idiot who's paying you ten dollars an hour to miss phone calls, nap in the bathroom and use my X-ray machine on Mexican food. . . . . Well, I wanted to know what's inside a chimichanga. If you didn't know what's in it, why'd you order it. 'Cause it's fun to say chimichanga. Chimichanga. See. How was work. Horrible. All he did was boss me around. "Do this, do that, wake up.. Maybe that's because I'm your boss. A stupid, stinky boss. Does anybody want to know about my problems. It was supposed to be Sloppy Joes for lunch, but instead they had fish sticks. Well, it ruined my day. [PHONE RINGING. No, no, no, I'll get it. That's what I do. That's all I'm good for. Hello. Oh, fudge. Picture an entire day of this... with six lines. Hello. Oh, hi, Mrs. Harper. Oh, great. Kandi, Kandi, give me the phone. Back off, bucko. Was your ex-husband always such a control freak. She says you were. You know what he did today. Kandi, Kandi, you don't have to get into that with her, okay. She says she wants to know. Well, first of all at the office he tried to make me call him "Dr. Harper" all day, and when I forgot he yelled at me. What. Chiropractors aren't really doctors. You liar. I so get why you dumped him. Hey, Alan? What. Is this a new lamp. Okay, I will call you Judith. Great, I'll see you there. See her... her where. We are going out for a drink and a little girl talk. Girl talk with my ex-wife. Her name is Judith. Mr. I'm-not-a-doctor Harper. Don't wait up. Wow. You just crapped where you used to eat. âª Men . Hey. Hey. What are you doing up so late. What time is it. It's 3:00 a.m. Oh, well, I got my eight hours. What are you doing, waiting up for Kandi. Oh, no, no, no. I, uh, I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd read a little. A furniture catalog. I like furniture. Just looking at the pictures, huh. What are you getting at, Charlie. I think you buy things. I think... you bought this lamp. That's the same lamp that was here when I moved in. Oh, really. Charlie, I'm afraid that this dry streak is starting to affect your mind. Maybe you're right. Sure, this is my lamp. I've had it for years. The table it's on is new. I knew it. [DOOR OPENING] KANDI: Shh. We don't want to wake up Mr. Alan Hitler. No, no, Osama Bin Alan. [LAUGHING. [SLURRING WORDS]: Oops. Busted. What the hell is going on here. [SLURRING WORDS]: The hell that is going on here is that I need an advance on my amilony. Why. To pay Estafan our limo driver. You took a limo. We couldn't find our cars, and we spent all our money on Jell-O shots and chimichangas. All right, all right. Kandi, you need to go to bed. We have to get up early for work. No, we don't, 'cause I quit. Why don't we talk about this in the morning. All right, Judith, Here is your... "amilony.. Thank you. Go home. And, Kandi, go to bed. Nuh-uh. I do not wish to live with you any furthermore. What. I have been invited to stay with my good friend Judith. [CHUCKLES. Come on, I'll help you pack your things. Did you ever notice how much he sweats during s*x. Well, good for you. Good for me. How is this good for me. You finally got Kandi out of the house. I didn't want her out of the house, and I certainly didn't want her moving in with my ex-wife. Oh, right. All right, then... good for me. âª Men . WOMAN: Harper. Here. I'm going to have to check your pie. Rhubarb. Oh, all of my girls like rhubarb. Okay, inmate 37059. Down the hall, third door on the left. There's a button by the bed. Push it if she gets violent. Thank you. [BELL RINGS. It won't open. Try it again. [BELL RINGS. Boy, you're really having a dry streak, aren't you. [DOORBELL RINGING] [GASPS. I can't even get laid in a women's prison. [DOORBELL RINGING. Hi. Are you Alan. No, I'm his brother, Charlie. Oh, well, I'm looking for Kandi. She told me she was living here. Actually, she moved. It's a very funny story. Are you a friend. I'm her mother. Oh. Well, come on in. I'll see if I can find a forwarding address. Thank you. Chimichanga. It's a beautiful place. Thank you. I see where Kandi gets her good looks. Thanks. Unfortunately, she gets her brains from her moron father. Oh, that's right. You're recently divorced. Would you like a drink. I would love one. Great. Why don't you step out on the deck and I'll be right there. Good news, it's raining out on my deck. Say what. The dry streak is over. So what am I supposed to do with this pie. âª Men 

season	Season-03j¦lEditor: Jk2writ. Pretty fancy prices here. Yeah, well, just so we're clear, I'm picking up the tab tonight. Okay. This is my celebration. I invited you. Fine. So don't go grabbing the check. I won't touch the check. I mean, if you want to leave the tip that would be all right. I could do that. I usually leave 15%, but if you want to leave 20... that's your call. Thank you. Unless you think it's easier if we just split the check. Whatever. Of course, in many families if someone is celebrating some good news, his brother would insist on buying dinner. Then why don't I do that. But I'll leave the tip. One question. What. Do you have any money. No. I left my wallet at home. You mean this wallet. Oh, good, you found it. I was looking all over. So, uh... where did we leave things. You're paying, we're splitting. Oh, just shut up. So anyway, what's this good news you're celebrating. It's a surprise. I want to wait till Mom gets here. Yes, Jake, we see the spoon on your nose. Now stop it. Can you do it. I don't want to do it. Now behave yourself. Oh, work with me. Just wonderful. You pick a restaurant that has no valet. I had to park three blocks away and then schlep here in shoes that are not made for walking. I've got a blister the size of a communion wafer, and if Mommy doesn't get something to drink immediately, things are going to get very ugly. Let the celebration begin. Maybe the lesson here, Mom, is to buy shoes that are made for walking. Is it just me. In a perfect world it would be. Well, anyway, I'm here. So what's your big announcement, Alan. Jake, get that spoon off your nose. You don't know where it's been. It's been on my nose. You really must start looking at trade schools for the boy. Now that we are all here, I have some good news to share. This is not going to be out on the newsstands for a couple of days, but I have an advance copy. "Good doctor, good neighbor, good guy.. Good God. Hey, Dad, you're famous. Well, not really. Well, among the readers of the Tarzana Pennysaver maybe a little. Don't forget the homeless people who make underpants out of it. Charlie, don't be disrespectful. Thank you, Mom. So how much advertising did you have to buy in exchange for this puff piece. Why do you assume that I had to buy advertising. Is it that hard to believe that a local newspaper might run a cover story about a successful local chiropractor. Well, frankly, yes. Unless the local chiropractor shot four people to death in a mini-mart and then turned the weapon on himself. You know, I get why Charlie has never been able to acknowledge my accomplishments. He's a self-centered hedonist who can't get behind anyone unless they're drunk and bent over a pool table. That's fair. But my own mother... You're... up. Refusing to even feign interest. I did so feign interest. You assumed that I had to buy advertising to get the article. Well, did you. Neighborhood advertising is a good investment. But that is not the point. All right, dear, what is the point. The point is I can't even get a simple "attaboy" from my own mother. Oh, well, I'm sorry. [CLEARING THROAT. Attaboy. Feel better. No, I do not feel better. Did I not say it right. You know what. Forget it. Let's just order, eat and get out of here. Oh, one more of these and please keep them coming. I'll buy the drinks. Unless you want to split it with me. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men âª âªOh. No, Alan, what else. I cannot believe that our mother made us carry her to her car, just because she had a teeny-weeny little blister on her foot. Well, hopefully the next time we have to carry her, she'll be in a handy urn. Oh, oh... I'll pay for the urn if you'll get the cremation. Done. Jake? Where's my son. Right here, Dad. Oh, oh, good. Uh, now listen, boy, your old dad is not going to be here for... Whee. He's not going to be here forever. And... and when I'm gone, I want there to be no doubt in your mind that I was as proud as punch about all of your accomplishments. No matter how minuscule. Boy, you're really plowed, aren't you. No. Your daddy doesn't get plowed. He just gets a little bzzz. Bzzz. Anyway, the important thing for you to know is how much I love you. You told the waiter you loved him, too. He was a very good waiter. And it's also important for you to know that you can be anything you want. Anything in the world. No, I can't. You're right. That's a crock. But I love you... And you have cheeks like a beaver. Now go to bed. You know, Dad, we've been learning about alcohol abuse at school, and if you ever need a new liver you can have half of mine. Hey, hey, hey, hey, I thought we had a deal. Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dad. Best five bucks I ever spent. Now come on, let's tuck you into bed. Why can't my mother appreciate me. All I wanted was once sincere "attaboy.. Is that too much to ask. [RETCHING. Attaboy. Well, that looks like the last of the scallops. Now all we got to do is wait for dessert. Rainbow sherbet. Oh, that should be pretty. You know, I have spent my entire life trying to please Mom, to make her proud of me, but no more. I... I am done trying. Good for you. Oh, uh, excuse me. Nope. You know, if you put the seat down, it's easier to rest your arms. Oh, you're right. You are a wise man, Charlie Harper. I do a have few pockets of specialized knowledge. Some might call it wisdom. And it seems warmer, too. You're further away from the cooling effect of the water. Not to mention the residual body heat accrued from thousands of ass-hours. Wow, you've really given a lot of thought to this. I'm thinking of writing a book. And I will read it. Thank you. You know what I am, Charlie. Yes. I'm a pathological people pleaser. Huh. I had an entirely different answer. But more accurately, I... I am a woman pleaser. No, Alan, I am a woman pleaser. You're a lonely guy speckled with vomit. I-I-I'm not speaking physically, I'm speaking psycholog... logically. With Mom, with Judith... with every woman I've ever met. I have twisted myself in knots just trying to get them to like me. My... my... my education, my... my job, my clothes, my car... my very behavior, all chosen simply to get women to approve of me. And how's that worked out for you. They don't approve of me. But I am going to change, Charlie. I am no longer going to grovel for Mom's approval or the approval of any-any woman. I am going to live the remainder of my life with pride and, and a quiet, noble dignity. But first I'll sleep with my head in the crapper. [TOILET FLUSHING. [NOISY CHEWING. Can I make you some oatmeal. I've got cereal. I know. I just thought you might enjoy something hot... and quiet. No. [CHEWING RESUMES. Do you have a hangover. Yeah. Drinking that much was a stupid thing to do. Then why did you do it. I don't know, Jake. Maybe I'm just stupid. Or maybe you just don't apply yourself. Will you stop talking for a while. Okay. [LOUD CRUNCHING. Although I do like a little conversation at breakfast. Morning, everybody. Shh. He's hung over. Oh, yeah. Well, isn't this an ironic turn of events. Me waking up feeling all bright and chipper, and you... looking like a stool sample. Not a big irony fan, huh. Charlie. Yeah. Either stop talking or at least have the decency to kill me. Boy, I'm never gonna drink. Good job. You scarred the kid for life. Now he's gonna face junior high sober. Just-just tell me one thing. What's that. Did I really tell the waiter I loved him last night. You had to say something after a kiss like that. I took care of your bathroom. Thank you. I hope you like the smell of pine-scented puke. So, did I do anything else I'm gonna regret. Well, you paid for dinner. Aw, geez. And after we got home, there was some drunken blubbering about how you weren't gonna grovel for the approval of women anymore. Oh, right. I almost forgot. I-I had a life-changing epiphany last night. Was this before or after you yanked up a hunk of your esophagus. No, it's no joke. I reached a turning point. From this day on, my actions will no longer be predicated on pleasing the castrating mother figures in my life. [CHUCKLING. Wha-What's so funny. Nothing. [CHUCKLING. I think she doubts your epiphany. She'll see. They'll all see. Starting now, I am new Alan. [BERTA CACKLING. Starting now, I will fear no women's disapproval. [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh, God, that's Judith. I was supposed to have Jake ready. She's gonna kill me. Okay, starting now. Good for you. [DOORBELL RINGS] Oh, I better get that. Let her wait. What she thinks of you doesn't matter. The only thing that counts is what you think of you. You're right. It's what I think of me. And. I had so much potential. You can forget what you think of you. Yeah, I'm probably too close to me to see me clearly. Yeah, that's it. Oh, do I smell like vomit. Don't worry. I'll stand next to you. She'll assume it's me. Good. Good. Hi, Alan. Jake ready. No, he is not. You said you'd have him ready. Well, I don't. And if that makes you unhappy with me, well, I don't give a rat's furry ass. What did you just say to me. Nothing. I'm sorry. Jake. Starting now? Starting soon. You know what that smell is. Epiphany... for men. So, how long you been in Los Angeles. . . . . About eight months. Haven't got a single audition yet. Yeah, this can be a tough town if you don't know anybody. [LONG SIGH. Do you have, like, a head shot or a resume. [LONG SIGH. Is he okay. I don't know. Sir, are you okay. I thought we came here to talk. Not to each other. [GROANS. All right, let's talk. What's bothering you. I changed my mind. I don't want to talk about it. Talk or die. All right. I'm depressed. I want to change, but-but I can't. Whenever I'm confronted by a disapproving woman, something inside me just crumbles. Well, I don't know. Maybe that's just who you are. You know? Fish got to swim, birds got to fly, you got to crumble. What I don't understand is that I can intellectually see the problem, but I just can't do anything about it. Oh, excuse me, miss, can I have more of these little pretzels, please. In a minute. Okay, sorry, no hurry. Look, it's very simple. You were conditioned as a child to seek Mom's approval. You're still seeking Mom's approval, and you make every woman in the world a substitute mom. But what about you? We had the same mother. Well, I handle my conditioning in a different way. I have casual and often degrading s*x with my substitute moms, but we're talking about you and not me, so forget I said that. Oh, how I'll try. But-but how do you deal with the fear of disapproval. I mean, you must get shot down occasionally. Occasionally? Constantly. Constantly. Occasionally. It's a numbers game, Alan. We all want the shiny apple on top of the tree. But sometimes you got to settle for one on a lower branch. And, of course, there's times when you just got to... pick up whatever's lying on the ground and put it in your mouth. But how do you manage to keep going on in the face of constant rejection. Occasional rejection. Okay, lesson one. Look around. Out of all the women here, which one do you find the most attractive. Let's see, um... ALAN: Her. CHARLIE: The brunette? Why. I don't know. There's just something about her. CHARLIE: Yeah. Radiating waves of contempt. You asked me who I found attractive. That's true. That's true. All right, she's your shiny apple. Now, go ask her if you can buy her a drink. What about the radiating waves of contempt. That's just a defense mechanism for a little girl in a lot of pain. Really? How the hell should I know. The point is, you can't let fear stand in your way. Well, I disagree. Are you questioning my methods. 'Cause we can stop right now. No, no, I'll do it, I'll do it. Would you like some more pretzels. Well, I am in the mood for something salty and twisted. [LAUGHS]: You're terrible. You have no idea. How'd it go. She's really got a mouth on her. So she rejected you. With anatomical specificity. Good. Good? How is that good. How do you feel right now. What do you mean, how do I feel? I feel humiliated. Where? What. Where is the humiliation? Where do you feel it. Well, let's see, my... Well, my stomach's all knotted. My heart is pounding. I'm sweating like a pig. Okay. End of lesson one. That was lesson one. Lesson one sucked. Lesson two. Have a drink. No, sweetheart, have a real drink. I don't like scotch. That's okay. It's bourbon. Oh. All right. Yecch. More. How do you feel now. I feel a little better. Finish the drink. Can I put some Diet Sprite in it. Just finish it. There you go. Now how do you feel. [GASPING. I feel pretty good. Like, you know, to hell with her. Who cares what she thinks. Perfect. Now, go ask that chick over there if you can buy her a drink. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's your big secret? Alcohol. Shh. Don't tell anybody. But isn't that just a temporary solution. It's only temporary if you stop drinking. I like it. Diet Sprite. [RETCHING. I got to hand it to you, Alan. Most guys would be off scallops for a long time. I like scallops. Clearly, they don't like you. I guess you choose your seafood like you choose your women. I beg to differ. When it comes to women, I make them sick. Fair enough. So, what else did we learn tonight. Well, let-let's see. I learned that-that to overcome my fear of rejection ingrained in me by an emotionally distant mother, I need to completely disable my central nervous system with semi-lethal quantities of alcohol. Bravo. Hey, Charlie, you coming to bed or what. I'll be there in a second. What are you looking at. Sorry, very sorry. So, how have you been. It worked. I am totally humiliated, and I don't care. You made real progress tonight, Alan, and I'm proud of you. Thanks, Charlie. You're-you're a good teacher. And-and a good brother. Thanks. Well... I guess it's time for me to go work out my issues. [TOILET FLUSHES. Good night, pal. Nighty-night. âª Men..

episode#!Episode-05-We Called It Mr. PinkyjÀlEditor: Jk2writ. Why do you have to leave. Charlie, I have to get home. I have to feed my cat. I have to feed my fish. We've been in bed for three days. I'm guessing the cat's fed and what's left of the fish is in the kitty litter. Well, I also have a job. Call in sick. I did it yesterday. Okay, call in horny. I'll write you a note. I wish I could. I love being with you. Me, too. And having you here just makes it all the better. You know, we've been seeing each other for over two months now, and you've never spent the night at my place. Okay, well, go clean up the dead animals and I'll come over tonight. Deal. I'll cook you dinner. Great. I think I love you, Charlie Harper. Thank you. I'll see you later. Wait a minute. Did you just say "thank you". Did I. Yes, I said "I think I love you," and you said "thank you.. What's that supposed to mean. Thank you. It's an expression of appreciation. Thank you. That's it. You don't have anything to add. Thank you... so very much. Great, that's-that's great. I open my heart to you and you couldn't care less. Well, that's not fair. I could care less, a lot less. Oh, come on, what do you want me to do? Lie to you. No, I want you to drop dead, you smug, cold-hearted son of a bitch. Phew, that could have been ugly. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... Hey, guess what happened at school today. You made the honor roll. What's that. Forget it. What happened at school. Well, there's this girl. Okay, now I'm listening. Her name is Robin Newberry. Name's not important, proceed. She gave me a cupcake. Yeah, so. I think she likes me. So what's the problem. Now I think she thinks I like her back. Do you. I didn't think I did, but it was a really good cupcake. Wow. What a perfect metaphor. No, it was a cupcake. Okay, blank slate, have a seat. I'm going to tell you something that will serve you well for your entire life. Like when you're peeing outside always face down wind. Better. By the way, what the hell were you thinking. I was thinking "Boy, I hope that's really warm rain.. Okay. Let's focus on today's lesson. Never ever confuse cupcakes with love. But I love cupcakes. We all love cupcakes. That doesn't mean you have to love the baker. Her mom baked it. You're missing the point. Robin just helped with the icing. Okay, okay. She made a smiley face with Red Hots. I get it. I'm just saying that when someone freely gives you her cupcake, your only obligation is to enjoy it. There's no reason to get emotionally involved. Why not? Because, if you do, the next thing you know, you'll be stuck eating the same damn cupcake for the rest of your life. But it was a really good cupcake. I can't stop thinking about it. Yeah. I've had cupcakes like that. But the thing you've got to remember is, there'll always be other cupcakes. And if the day should come when you find yourself in a cupcake drought... And those days come, don't kid yourself... Well, then you just shell out a couple of bucks for a nice Ho-Ho. Understand. I think so. Thanks, Uncle Charlie. No problem. Hey, what are you guys talking about. s*x. Well, how about that. The booger-eater grasped the symbolism. You were talking to my son about s*x. He came to me with a cupcake problem. I thought it was about s*x. I was using cupcakes as a metaphor. Jeez, the kid got it. Okay, walk me through the metaphor. Some little girl gave him a cupcake. Okay, okay, stop. Gave him a cupcake. Are we talking baked goods or are we talking some new hip-hop slang. Baked goods. I told him it was okay to enjoy the cupcake, without feeling emotionally obligated to the girl. So in essence, you just told my son it's okay to have s*x with a girl without having any feelings towards her. Lucky for us he asks me stuff I know about. There's no "us" here. There's no "lucky.. That's a terrible lesson. Hey, I could have done 20 minutes just on licking the icing. But I took the high road. Okay, okay, enough. Here's the deal. From now on, all cupcake conversations will be referred to me. Why. You don't know the difference between a Ding Dong and your elbow. Nevertheless, I do not want him learning about relationships from a misogynist. A misogynist. You're saying I'm a misogynist. Yes, Charlie, you are a misogynist. I'm a misogynist. Mm-hmm. I'm a misogynist. That is really low, Alan, calling your own brother a misogynist. G-I-N or G-E-N. G-Y-N. Thanks. I do not hate women. Oh, come on, Charlie. If anything, I am the opposite of a misogynist. I'm a... pro-sogynist. I love women. Oh, is that so. Even if there's no possibility of having s*x with them. What. Exactly. And it is precisely that attitude that I do not want my son to grow up with. Okay, okay. Hold it just a second. So you'd rather he grow up to be like you. Scared of women, manipulated by women. That's not true. Oh, please, look at your ex-wife. Say what you want about me, but at least I've never chosen to have women in my life who do nothing but mistreat me. BERTA: Hey, stud. I don't know what kind of sick, twisted party you had in your bedroom the last couple of days, but I sure as hell ain't cleaning it up. That is different, way different. âª Men Hey, Dad, what time is it. Uh, 20 after 6:00, why. 'Cause I have to call my girlfriend at 6:30. Um, w-what girlfriend. Robin Newberry. Cupcake Robin Newberry. Charlie, stay out of it. How can I stay out of it. If I saw a bus heading for him, would I not throw myself in front of it to save him. Would you? I'm just making a point here. Charlie, if you don't mind, I'll handle it. Jake, I thought we talked about this. Yeah, you said I shouldn't take a cupcake from a girl if I don't like her. That's right. So I decided to like her. We're exclusive. Exclusive. That means I don't talk to other girls and I get a cupcake every day. I better call now. If I'm late, she yells at me. Congratulations, Alan. You're son is officially pastry-whipped. ROSE: Marco. Not now, Rose. Marco. Rose, I'm not in the mood. Marco. Polo. Hey, Charlie. Hey. Is something wrong. I'm not sure. Rose, do you think I'm a misogynist. Oh, wow, yeah. Did somebody say you weren't. Marco. How can I be a misogynist. My whole life is a testament to my love for women. Oh, it's sweet that you think that. But what you call love is really just an obsession to control and dominate based on mistrust and hostility. Yeah, so. You forget I spent the night with you once. You don't make love to a woman. You overpower her. You subjugate her. You... ravage her. Anywho, it's obvious you're still trying to resolve long-standing Oedipal issues. Hold on. O-E-D... You sure. Yeah, I have a masters in psychology and I know how to spell. [MIMICKING ROSE]: I have a masters in psychology and I know how to spell. Here it is, Oedipus complex. Okay, that's what I thought. That's just sick. Unconscious, unresolved sexual feeling towards my mother. I didn't write the dictionary, Charlie. But it's not true. I despise my mother. Consciously, yes. And that's why you conflate s*x and aggression. It's textbook misogyny. "Conflate". Come on, what is it, fancy word day. It means to join together. Thank you. So what are you saying. You will never be able to have a trusting and truly loving relationship with any woman, until you resolve your feelings about your mother. Ah... broads have been telling me that for years. It's a lot of hooey. It's okay, Charlie. The world is filled with women who seek out misogynists. Women who need men to mistreat them and provide them with angry, aggressive s*x in order to satisfy their own twisted pathology. I see. Well, I guess I'll just have to look for a woman like that. Marco. âª Men Thanks for giving me another chance. You were so darling on the phone, I couldn't resist. Look, I know I know I've got some intimacy issues, but I'm working on them. And if you could just be patient with me, I think you and I could truly... conflate. What's conflate mean. [SCREAMING. Look, you don't have to go. Relax, Charlie. All men have performance problems occasionally. No, no, no, no, it's not officially a performance problem until we give up. Right now it's just unusually long foreplay. I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work. Damn, my carpal tunnel's acting up. How about if I come with you. We can give it a shot in your car. It's okay. I still love you. Thank you. I mean, I really appreciate your understanding and support during this dark time. I'll call you. What. Nothing. Go ahead, say it. I, uh, I have nothing to say. Except, you know... ha-ha. Oh, my. Don't tell me I got a rise out of you. Alan, I am right on the edge. Be very careful. Sorry. I didn't realize it was so impotent. You forget one thing. Oh, what's that. I can still run. âª Me. [DOORBELL RINGS. EVELYN [OVER SPEAKER]: Yes. Mom, it's me, Charlie. I-I'm a little busy right now. What do you want? We need to talk. About what. About how I'll never be able to have a meaningful relationship with a woman because of the way you screwed me up. Oh. Well... sorry about that. Let me in. There's more. Yes. [LONG SIGH. . . . . Will this having children thing never end. [DOOR BUZZES] Mom. Look, I'm sorry this is such a major inconvenience for you... Oh, God. What are you doing. Downward Facing Dog. What. It's yoga, Charlie. Oh. Well, could your dog possibly face upward while we talk. Fine. Aw, geez. What the hell is the mutt doing now. Charlie, just say what you came to say. Okay, well, are you aware that I'm a misogynist. Really. I raised you Episcopalian. This isn't funny. My anger and mistrust towards women starts with you. Which wasn't a problem until it spilled over into my s*x life. So you're blaming mummy because little Charlie can't come out and play. Okay, first of all, we don't call it "little Charlie.. What do we call it, darling. We don't call it anything. Well, when you were a baby, we called it Mr. Pinky. I may never have s*x again. Wait a sec. Mr. Pinky was the cat. What did we call your pen1s. It doesn't matter. The point is, it isn't working anymore. And somehow it's all tied up in some sick twisted knot with you. Mr. Peepee. Well, you can see why I confused that with Mr. Pinky. Mom, I learned about relationships from watching you. And you know what toxic little lessons I learned. Tell me, sweetheart. I learned that men who get emotionally involved get stepped on. I learned that men who get married get emasculated. I learned that the best way to not get your heart broken is to pretend you don't have one. You learned all that from me? Yes. Darling, I've never been more proud of you than I am at this moment. You're joking, right. Not at all. For the first time, I look at you and I see myself. Oh, that's just insane. [SCREAMING. âª Men Save room for dessert. I bought brownies. No, thanks. Brownies just remind me of cupcakes. His, uh, his little girlfriend dumped him. Really. She said she needed her space. I'm sorry, buddy. Want some advice. Yeah. What do I do, Uncle Charlie. I meant from me. Oh. No, thank you. Well. Might as well listen to your dad, 'cause... I got nothing. Less than him. Fellas, I am the sick puppy of a downward dog. The only thing I'm good for is drinking out of a toilet and sniffing my own ass. Which, by the way, I saw our mother do earlier. [SIGHS]: Okay, what do you think. Marco. Oh, geez. Don't do that. Sorry. Are you okay. Oh, sure. Everything I believed in is wrong. Everything I thought I was, I'm not. And Mr. Peepee's on the fritz. Mr. Peepee. Yeah, that's what my mother used to call... Oh, don't make me explain this, Rose. Okay. But he's on the fritz, you say. Yes. Well, I'm not surprised. The depth of your pathology, coupled with the intensity of your denial, was bound to manifest itself physically, sooner or later. In plain, simple English, Rose. When your mind gets crazy, Mr. Peepee gets lazy. Let me put it another way. When your psyche gets iffy, you can't get a stiffy. Stop it. Stop it. Just tell me how I can fix it. Well, there's no quick fix when it comes to limp... Rose. No more rhymes. Are you sure? I got a beauty with "toner.. Okay. Well, traditional therapy can help, but you'll have to commit to a long, arduous process of self-exploration over a period of years. Years. I can't go years without... Mr. Peepee. Charlie, isn't your long-term mental and emotional health more important than a few fleeting orgasms. It's not even more important than one. Okay, well, in that case, I suppose we could try a shortcut like hypnotherapy. You know how to do that. I studied it. But for it to work, you'd have to trust me completely. You know, Rose, as strange as it may seem, out of all the women I know, you're the only one I trust at all. Wow. Personally I find that very flattering, while professionally, it's deeply disturbing. So just relax, sit back, close your eyes, and listen only to the sound of my voice. I just want to get my mother out of my head, okay. I don't want to quit drinking or gambling or any of the good stuff. All right. Okay. So just relax. [CHUCKLES]: Oh, my. I see everything's back to normal. Better than normal. Did you take one of those pills. No, I don't need any pills; it's all me. And nobody else. Now, why don't you just relax while I introduce you to the new, improved Charlie. [PHONE RINGING. [CLUCKING LIKE A CHICKEN. [CONTINUES CLUCKING. Who were you calling. I was just ordering a little chicken. âª Me. What smells so good. Your kid's in the kitchen baking. You're kidding. Hey, dad, want a cupcake. Um, sure. Uncle Charlie. Thank you. Have as many as you want. I got another batch in the oven. It's, uh, it's very tasty. What, uh, what prompted this. I figured out I don't need a girlfriend. If I want a cupcake, I just make it myself. Taking matters into his own hands. The metaphor is now complete. Anybody want to lick the beater. No. No. [OVEN TIMER DINGS. [CLUCKING LIKE A CHICKEN. What

episode%#Episode-08-That Voodoo That I Do DojïfEditor: Jk2writ. Oh, I knew it. There's no extra foam in my latte. You ask for extra foam, you might as well be asking for a piggyback ride, you know what I mean. Charlie? Charlie. Oh! Of course. Man's got a heat-seeking missile in his pants. Is it too much to ask that when we go out for a cup of coffee you at least stay within earshot so I'm not talking to myself like a crazy person. And again, I'm talking to myself like a crazy person. [HUSHED]: Look. Yes, I see. Girl pretty. Charlie like. No, girl magnificent. Charlie buy her Lexus. Okay, I thought we were going to be hanging out together, but obviously, your neurotic need for meaningless s*x is more important than spending time with your only brother, who despite everything, continues to love you, and is, by the way, your best hope for a viable kidney transplant. You can get yourself home, right. What, what makes you think that she's even available. Maybe she's married. Maybe she's gay. Maybe she's a guy. Hey, I don't see a ring, a girlfriend or a bulge. Now if you'll excuse me, it's time to do that voodoo that I do do so well. Hi. I'm Charlie. Don't care. And you are. Not interested. How do you know. I know. Okay, then. What, you think it's over. 'Cause it's not over. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I guess I was misled by her complete and utter indifference to you. Yeah, well, watch and learn. So... Go away. How about now? Is it over now. It's not an exact science. Look, if you knew me at all and shut me down, that would be one thing, but to be dismissed on a simple hello, that's a tough pill to swallow. Would you rather I give it to you in a suppository. Well, to be perfectly honest... Good-bye. Hey, hey, did you hear that. What. It's a, it's a fat lady and she's... singing. You'd give up right now, wouldn't you. Charlie, Elvis has left the building. Giving up is a little moot at this point. Yeah, well, that attitude is why you sleep alone with a copy of Monster Boobs magazine under your pillow. Stay out of my room. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men... âª Men, men, men, men, manly men . âª Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh, ooh-oo. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men. . âª Men. "Waverly Dance Studio, 3737 Waverly Street.. Got it. "Westwood Academy of Dance, 14001 Pico Boulevard.. What's going on. I'm mapping out all the dance studios in a five-mile radius of the coffee shop. Why. I can't stop thinking about that girl I met. I have to find her. Hmm, it's a shame you can't let your pen1s sniff a piece of her clothing. Look, I know her name: Mia. It was written on her coffee cup. I know she's a dancer. She was wearing those leg-warmer thingies and reading a dance magazine. Just 'cause you're reading a dance magazine doesn't make you a dancer. Why not? You're a monster boob. Will you both stay out of my room?. I'll tell you something. Why do you want to go to all this trouble to track down a girl who showed less than no interest in you. A girl who seemed actually repulsed by your very being. A girl whose skin visibly crawled at your mere proximity. Yeah, but did you see her butt. It was like a ripe little peach. That's your answer? Her ass reminded you of fruit. Berta, explain it to him. Well, a lot of the times a peach will have a subtle cleft in it that is visually reminiscent of a woman's... Thanks, thanks. I got it. Alan, do you know why Sir Edmund Hillary wanted to scale Mount Everest. Because it reminded him of a big pointy melon. That's part of the reason. But the main reason was he wanted to do it because everyone thought it was impossible. No, I'm missing the connection here. If a girl like Mia were easy to climb, her head would be covered with flags. So you're looking for a challenge. Exactly. No one takes a picture of the fish that jumps on your boat. I'm confused. Is she a mountain or a fish. Doesn't matter. Either way, I'm going to scale her. And you, why do you enable this behavior. Why? I'll tell you why. Because your brother is the embodiment of the can-do, roll-up-your-sleep spirit that made this country great. He never gets discouraged; he goes after what he wants; and he doesn't know the meaning of the word quit. And if the day should come when any man, no matter how humble, can't go out there and soil the loins of some hot little dancer well, I don't want to live in that America. âª O, beautiful, for spacious skies . âª For amber waves of grain... Demi plie, grand plie. Okay, very good. Now reverse, demi plie, demi plie, grand plie. Oh, leave me alone. Keep going. Hey, you're a teacher. Hey, you're a stalker. No, no, I was just passing by and happened to look in the window. What's the map for. Oh, this. Well, I had to go to eight other dance studios before I found the right window. Okay, I suppose that could be interpreted as stalking, but it could just as easily be seen as sincerity, persistence, enthusiasm. Mental illness. Oh, come on. I'm clearly smitten. Throw me a bone. Charlie... You remembered my name. That's got to mean something. Yeah, I wrote it down in case I needed to call the cops. Charlie, I don't have time for dating right now. I'm completely focused on my work. Okay, let's talk about work. I've always wanted to learn to dance. Can you teach me. I only teach children. You don't have a class full of large, slow kids I could be part of. All right, how about this. My nephew loves to dance. A gifted little boy. Moves like a gazelle. How old is he. I don't know. 11, 12. It's hard to say. He's got a big head. Frankly, I'd love to have a boy in the class. It's hard to get males that age excited about ballet. Really? 'Cause Jake is just "ballet" this and "ballet" that. Yeah, I'm sure. Tell you what. Why don't you bring him by tomorrow. Great. Maybe afterward, you and I... Charlie, listen carefully. You and I? Never gonna happen. Understood. See you tomorrow. Charlie to base camp. [MIMICS RADIO STATIC. I'm beginning my ascent. âª Men. How do you liking the pizza your old Uncle Charlie bought especially for his little buddy. It's good. Well, save room. I've got a half gallon of that double fudge brownie ice cream you like. I don't know. I'm pretty stuffed. You sure. Maybe after I poop. What are you doing. We're eating dinner. You had dinner an hour ago. Well, then he won't need breakfast. I'm on a roll. You had enough to eat. Hey, Jake, you know what I like to do after a nice big meal. What. Learn to dance. Charlie? Yeah. Private word. Sure. What's up. Shame on you. Is that it. You found that girl and now you have some kind of depraved plan to use my son as bait. Yeah, so? It's not like you pay his rent. Why shouldn't he pitch in. I will not allow it. Oh, come on. It's just a couple of ballet lessons. Ballet? Him. I think he has a quiet grace about him. He doesn't have to be good at it. He just has to show up. One lesson. I'm begging you. You know what. It really doesn't matter what I say. You will never convince him to take ballet. But if I can, will you stay out of it. I guess. Great. Hey, Jake... Okay, that might have been bad parenting. I've got a surprise for you. Not more food, is it. I'm starting to feel a little dizzy. No, you're going to get to do something that I'll bet no other boy in your class has ever done. If it's s*x, Mitchell Fineman already saw his cousin naked. No, this is better than s*x. What. How would he know. You're going to learn to dance ballet. Want to bet. Okay, let me put it this way. How much money will I have to give you to take ballet lessons. How about ten dollars. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. I want a thousand dollars. That's really not ethical. Oh, yeah. I'm the one on shaky moral ground. Okay, I'll give you $500. Split the difference. $250. Done. âª Men. Come on. Let's go. I changed my mind. You took my money. I'll give it back. Jake, we're here. You may as well give it a try. Yeah. Give it a try. Who knows? You might like it. I will never forgive you for this. âª Men. You didn't tell me I'd be the only boy here. So? The odds are on your side. The odds for what? I'm 11. I want to go home. I thought we had a deal. Charlie, you can't make him stay if he doesn't want to. I love you, Dad. All right, let's get started. Whoa. Who's that. Your teacher. Come on, let's go. Hang on, Dad. Maybe I should give this a chance. Hi. I'm Jake. Hi, Jake. It's nice to meet you. Yeah. You uncle tells me you like ballet. Yeah. Okay. How about you line up with the girls and we'll get started. Yeah. How about that? He's got a crush. It's like watching a dog chase a car. He'll never catch it, and even if he did, he couldn't drive it. He's still doing better than you. Everyone, I'd like you to meet our new student, Jake. GIRLS: Hi, Jake. Yeah. Hi. Okay, let's start in first position. Jake, do you know first position. Is that like missionary position. One... and two... and three... and four. I will never forgive you for this. He's having a great time. [UNDER BREATH]: The clueless knucklehead. Okay, very nice, class. Yeah, good hustle, everybody. You're much better, Jake. That's 'cause I have a good teacher. Thank you. . . . . All right, that's it for this week. And remember, life is a dance. Live it gracefully. That's my motto. Well, that settles it, I want to be a ballet dancer when I grow up. Really. There's a load off my mind. It's not as easy as it looks, you know. It's pretty hard. It's pretty hard to watch. Thanks. Did you see how far Mia could put her leg over her head. I did notice that, yes. So what do you think. Fred Astaire or Fred Flintstone. He's got a lot of enthusiasm. Yeah, he gets that from me. I thought you were his uncle. Well, that's the whole nature-nurture debate, isn't it. So, listen, Mia... I'm not going out with you, Charlie. I know that. You made it very clear. My question was, is there any more we can do to help Jake. Extra classes, private tutoring, the three of us in Cabo for a long weekend. If he comes to class regularly I think you'll be amazed at his progress. Good. I'd hate to think he's peaked. In fact, we're having a recital next month, and with a lot of work and a little luck we can include him. Charlie to base camp. [IMITATES RADIO STATIC. Pretty cold up here. Visibility zero. [ORCHESTRA PLAYING WALTZ. [ORCHESTRA PLAYING WALTZ. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING. . . . I hope you like this. It's an impertinent little Cabernet with oaky overtones and just a hint of a floral finish. Wow, you really know your wine. No, I just read it off the box. So, what's the plan, get me drunk and take advantage of me. Oh, good, you've done this before. I had a very nice time tonight. Was it worth all the trouble I put you through. You tell me. Ask me again in the morning. Charlie to base camp. I can see the summit. Hey. Hey, Jake. What are you doing up. Why shouldn't I be up. Well, isn't it a little past your bedtime. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have a bedtime. Okay. So what's going on. Not too much. Where's your dad, Jake. I don't know. Why don't you go look for him. Look, Jake, Mia and I are kind of busy right now. Busy doing what. Talking. Okay. What are we talking about. We're not talking about anything. You're going to bed. Why don't we let Mia decide. Jake, sweetheart, I think you should go to bed. Are you sure. You don't have to decide right now. Your uncle and I would like to spend some alone time together. Oh. All right. You want me to tuck you in. I'm too old to get tucked in, you... you ass-face. Okay, then. Sleep tight, little camper. Kids, huh. Yeah, kids. He never called me an ass-face before. I think he's a little jealous. Yeah. I remember feeling like that when I was his age. Really. The cafeteria lady. Looked like Valerie Bertinelli, but you know, with a hairnet and just the cutest whisper of a mustache. She didn't know I was alive. You poor thing. I'm sorry, Mia, I can't... I can't do this to him. Do what to him. One afternoon I saw the cafeteria lady holding hands with the shop teacher in the parking lot, and it just killed me. Mr. Danopoli. I'll never forget it. She was holding the hand with the missing thumb. You know what. I've got to take you home. I understand. You do. You love Jake. You'd rather give up spending the night with me than risk hurting his feelings. Right. Although, when you spell it out like that it sounds incredibly stupid. You're a very sweet man. Thank you. I was kidding. Let's go upstairs. Charlie, take me home. No, no, no. Let's talk about this. He's 11. He'll get over it. I got over One-Thumb Danopoli. You asleep. You can quit faking. I took her home. Really. Yeah. How come. It's part of the guy code. When two friends like the same girl, one of them has to step aside. Unless she's a good sport, in which case it's like Saturday morning at the bakery. That's a complicated code. Don't worry about it. Bottom line is... I'm out of the Mia business. Cool. Now go to sleep. Uncle Charlie. Yeah. I'm sorry I called you an ass-face. Yeah. I forgot about that. [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING. No woman is worth this. I am so proud. Our little boy is growing up

showTwo-And-Half-MenjhEditor: Jk2writ. Uh-oh. Good morning. Morning. Charlie, right. Well, I guess it's too late to deny it. Would you like some coffee. Uh... sure. I would. You have a beautiful house. Thank you... so much. My name is Sandy. Oh, yes... of course it is. How could I forget. Sandy like the beach or the... Koufax. Pardon me. You know, Sandy Koufax... great Dodger pitcher, Hall of Famer, never mind. So, Sandy... how'd you... sleep. Oh, just fine. How about you. Great. Like a drunk baby. Are you hungry. Not yet. Maybe after I throw up. What did you do last night. Actually, I was hoping you could fill me in. There's my little Sandy beach. Good morning, Alley-Oop. Oh, thank God. I was afraid I was gonna have to quit drinking. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh âª Men âª So, what do you think of Sandy. Arguably the greatest southpaw in the history of baseball. My Sandy. I don't know. I've never seen her pitch. She sure can cook. Well, guess how we met. I suppose we can rule out Dodger Stadium. In cooking class. You've been taking a cooking class. Where do you think I go every Tuesday night. You're not here on Tuesday nights. No. I'm in cooking class. And guess who's the teacher. Who. Sandy. Oh. Who's Sandy. That's Sandy. Oh. Great story. Alan is my star pupil. And you are my star teacher. [BOTH GIGGLING. Yo. Can I have some more bacon. Oh. In a jiff. My mother always said, "A well-fed man is a happy man.. Our mother always said, "Here's ten bucks for pizza. Don't wait up.. That reminds me, she called and invited us for Christmas. You told her yes, right? Absolutely. I thought you and I were going to spend Christmas together. We are. But you're going to your mother's. What gave you that idea. You see, Sandy, it's kind of a family tradition. Every year, our mother invites us, even though she doesn't want us to come. We say yes, even though we don't want to go. Then, when we don't show up, even though she's relieved, she gets to complain to her friends about what horrible children she has. It's the perfect gift. But Christmas is supposed to be about spending time with your loved ones. Yeah, and going to our mother's would cut into that. This way, Alan gets to spend it with his son, and I get to play stuff the stocking in Vegas with a couple of saline-enhanced elves. Does this mean that I'm finally going to meet your son. I guess it does. Gosh, I so hope he likes me. The way you cook, your only problem's gonna be keeping him from humping your leg. [BUZZING. Oh, that's the sheets. If you fold them while they're warm, they don't wrinkle. Huh. Huh. Beauty, s*x, cooking, laundry. Marriage, boredom, alimony, death. You are such a cynic. And you are such a sap. How am I a sap. Are you blind. She's a nester. What's that supposed to mean. It means she throws you some tail, a couple pieces of bacon, and bibbity-bobbity-boo, you've got a roommate. Bibbity-bobbity-boo. Isn't that from Cinderella. You don't think that bitch was a nester. I find that just a couple of drops of lemon juice on the dryer sheet really freshens up the whole load. Really. I find that just a couple Valiums in my coffee keeps me from snapping necks. Well, um, hold this, please. I'm just going to pop these on the bed while they're still warm and toasty. So which one of you guys is slipping the high hard one to Martha Stewart. Hey, Brandi, it's Charlie Harper. Listen, I'm coming back to Vegas for Christmas, and I was wondering if you and your sister wanted to celebrate the holidays again. Harper. Oh, wait. It's possible that you remember me as Dr. Philip Gonzalez. Right. Yeah. Hola. Anyway, I'm sitting here making vacation plans, and I'm thinking where better to commemorate the birth of our Lord than Caesar's Palace. Hey, Charlie. Hungry. Hold on, Brandi. Not really, but listen, Sandy... Now last chance. I'm gonna start dinner, so the kitchen's gonna be off limits for a while. But it's my kitchen. So. I just thought it was important to point out. You're so cute. Look, Brandi, talk to your sister, work up an estimate, and I'll call you back. SANDY: I've got a surprise for you. A mini-blind brush. BERTA: A what. SANDY: I don't think Alan's blinds have been dusted in months, but that's probably because you didn't have the proper tool. BERTA: Gee, thanks. We got to talk. I'm on it. You better be or else she's gonna be on it. Because now I have the proper tool. Listen, Sandy... You had your chance, Charlie. If you're hungry, take a pudding cup. I don't want a pudding cup. We need to establish a few ground rules. Oh, okay. I'm listening. Okay, well, first of all, Berta's been with me for a long time. And what she lacks in housekeeping skills, she more than makes up for in upper body strength. What's that. Rack of lamb. Really? Mm-hmm. You're making that for us. Yep. With roasted baby potatoes and caramelized carrots. Ooh. Anyway, anyway... Ground rules. Now I want to be supportive of you and Alan... Oh, I'm sorry, one quick question. Chocolate or raspberry soufflÃ©. It doesn't matter. The point is... I'll just make raspberry. Actually, I prefer chocolate. Chocolate it is. Now why don't I mix you up a little cocktail and you can take a nap before dinner. A nap would be nice. Can I still have the pudding cup. Okay. But just one. I don't want you spoiling your appetite before dinner. Thank you. Well. Good news. We're having rack of lamb for dinner. ALAN: Oh, no. I'm hungry. Where's Sandy. She went to get a honey-baked ham for Christmas Eve dinner. Ooh, honey-baked ham. Yay. I find it a little ironic that despite all your warnings about her nesting instincts, you haven't missed a single one of her meals. Yeah, I'm a master of irony. Hey, I thought you were going to Vegas for Christmas. Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Then you'd have the whole ham to yourself. You should talk, Porky. Who took the leftover lasagne under the deck so that we wouldn't see him eat it all himself. Who made a meatloaf sandwich by taking a slice of meatloaf and putting it between two other slices of meatloaf. I am cutting down on carbs. Yeah, it's working for you. When's the last time you looked down in the shower and saw your testicles. I don't need to see them. I know they're there. And what about you. What do you call this. Goodyear or Pirelli. This, my chunky friend, is water weight. Water weight. It's genetic. I retain water. You also retain German chocolate cake, lamb stew and Belgian waffles. Hey, people who live in fat asses shouldn't throw waffles. Don't talk about my ass. I am very self-conscious about my ass. I'm sorry. I'm just lashing out 'cause I haven't eaten in 75 minutes. You want some of Sandy's homemade fudge. Don't play with me, Alan. You've got fudge up here. Close your eyes. Okay. Mm... fudge. Aw. Oh, you know what would be great. Honey-baked fudge. Or fudge-covered ham. Mm... Mm... Well, I'm really happy that we get to spend Christmas together. We don't have to go to your mom's, do we. Don't be silly. Hey, you hungry. I could eat. Well, you're gonna. Can we order Chinese like we did last year. Oh, no, no. This year, we're gonna do something a little more traditional. Deli. No, we're gonna have a-a real, home-cooked Christmas dinner. Whose home. Our home. How. Well, I'm, uh, I'm dating a-a lady who's gonna make us a wonderful dinner. Oh, okay. Are you at all curious. Yeah, a little. Well, okay, you can, uh, ask me any question, and I'll try and answer it for you. What are we having. No, about the lady. Oh. No, not really. Well, I-I just want you to know that I-I really like her, and you're probably gonna be seeing her a lot. Do I have to like her. Well, of course not. Then I probably won't. Why would you say that. We're very different people, Dad. So true. Is she gonna be staying over. Yes. Where is she gonna sleep. In my room. Okay. Just remember, the walls are thin, and I'm impressionable. âª Men. Hey, what are doing out here. I thought I should prepare you. For what. Alan, remember what I told you about nesters. Yeah. Well, some are hummingbirds, some are robins. But you my friend... You got yourself a partridge in a freakin' pear tree. Sandy did all this. Yup. I think it's cool. It's like an amusement park. Yeah, Six Flags Over Crazy-Ass Chick-land. This cannot be Jake. You're too grownup-looking. Yeah, thanks. Are those for anybody. Help yourselves. [SNIFFING. ALL: Mmm, gingerbread. Jake, you can help me in the kitchen if you like. I'm making chocolate eclairs for dessert, and I need an official taster. I like her. Well, look at that. They're bonding already. Alan, your kid would join the Taliban if they made their own s'mores. So-So, when did she do all this decorating. Hard to say. Everything was normal up until lunchtime. Oh, I missed lunch. What did you have. . . . . She made me a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich... Oh. ...with garlic mayonnaise on sourdough toast. Oh! Damn. Anyway, after lunch, I took a little nap and woke up in Santa's village of the damned. Why do you have to be so cynical. There is nothing wrong with decorating your home to show a little holiday spirit. Aha. But it's not her home, is it. Well, no. Whose home is it, Alan. Okay, fine, I will have a talk with her. Hold it. What. After dinner, you nimrod. Anybody have room for another eclair. Not unless I unbutton my pants. Mine are already unbuttoned. I took mine off when she brought out the marshmallow yams. Okay, then. What do you say we all go into the living room and sing some Christmas carols. You mean stand up. I don't think I can. I'm not wearing pants. Come on, guys. What's Christmas without caroling. Chanukah. âª Jingle bells, jingle bell. âª Jingle all the wa. âª Oh, what fun it is to rid. âª In a one-horse open sleigh... âª Hey. Sandy, something wrong. Who moved the reindeer. I don't know that one, but I'll wing it. [TO "JOY TO THE WORLD"]: âª Who moved the reindee. âª The savior's com. âª He's coming to check on the reindeer... âª No, no, no, no. These reindeer. What about them. Donner and Blitzen are out of order. Somebody's been playing with them. So. So, I want to know who it was. Jake. I didn't do it. Charlie. Oh all right. I may have used one of 'em as a swizzle stick. [SIGHS. Well, no harm done. But if you must play with them, please remember, it's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen. Okay. Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen. Got it. Say it. Donner, Blitzen. Okay then. "The Little Drummer Boy.. âª Brrum, Brru. âª Brrum, Brrum [PLAYING DISCORDANT NOTE. âª Come, they told me, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum . âª A newborn king to see, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum . âª The finest gifts we bring, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum . âª To lay before the king, pa-rum-pa-pum-pum . âª Rum-pa-pum-pum... Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen. Alan, why aren't you asleep. I don't know. Just excited about Christmas, I guess. Well, Santa won't come while you're awake. Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that. Now close your eyes, and let visions of sugarplums dance through your wee little head. Okay. [GASPS. Oh, no. What. I-I forgot to put out cookies and milk for Santa. Oh. You're kidding, right. Do you want coal in your stocking. Because that's what you're gonna get if Santa doesn't find a snack when he comes down the chimney. I see. So, you believe in the vengeful, Old Testament Santa. Are you mocking Christmas. Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no. You know what. Well, I'll just take care of the milk and cookies. You-You just relax and-and go to sleep. He sees us when we're sleeping, you know. Right. I don't make the rules. Okay. [TO "THE FIRST NOEL"]: âª Oh, God, Oh, Go. âª Oh, God, Oh, God. Charlie. Hang on. [TOILET FLUSHES. [SIGHS. Okay, I'm ready for more pie. We have a serious problem here. We're out of pie. Will you listen to me. There's something wrong with Sandy. Well, didn't we know that when she agreed to sleep with you. No. Even wronger than that. She actually believes in Santa Claus. Really? Yeah. Wow. But we still have pie. Yes, we still have pie. Then what are we doin' up here. I guess I could have a little sliver. You know what. I think something's wrong with Sandy. I just said that. Do you ever listen to me. Sandy, sweetheart. You okay. He's not coming. Who's not coming. [WHISPERS]: Listen to this. Santa. Every year I try and make things perfect, and every year I fail. Mama was right. I am a naughty girl. Come on, Alan. Where we going. I want you to teach this naughty girl a lesson. She needs to be punished. You lucky dog. What? I'm not going in there. She's nuts. Yeah. So. s*x with crazy chicks is great. Just make sure you pick positions where you can see what her hands are doing. No, no. That would be taking advantage of a-a mentally unbalanced person. Oh, Alan, that boat has sailed. You might as well hop on board for a farewell cruise. I don't think so. It-It just wouldn't be right. SANDY: Come on, Alan. I'm ready. Good night. Okay. Pie for everybody. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Are you out of your mind. Mom, you've been naggin' us for years to spend Christmas with you. Only because I knew you'd never show up. Well, we had to get out of the house. Yeah. The walls are thin, and I'm impressionable. Hold on. Stanley, put your pants on. We'll exchange gifts later. Come on in. Dear God, look at the size of your ass

season	Season-03jÍhEditor: Jk2writ. I'm sure she's a lovely girl, Mom, but I have a strict policy against blind dates. Yes, I know I'm not God's gift to women, but, nevertheless... Oh, come on. How do you know what she can suck through a garden hose. Doesn't matter. The policy stands. Okay, bye. You know, while I applaud your blind date policy, I would encourage you to consider a garden hose exemption. I'm sorry, but you remember the last time I let Mom fix me up. Oh, yeah. The enema freak. She was a colonic irrigation therapist. Tomato, tomahto... You still wound up with five gallons of coffee up your keister. Not a pleasant memory. I can't remember it without chuckling. These days, they'll open a Starbucks anywhere. Are you done. No. Wait. One more. You had the venti nonfat "crappuccino"... ...with extra foam. Mmm. Okay, I'm done. So what's wrong with the TV. I don't know. I think that storm last night messed up the satellite dish. I'll call the guy on Monday. That's your answer for everything. "Call the guy.. Not for everything. Often, I'll call the girl. Course, there was the one time that the girl turned out to be the guy. Needless to say, I got a full cash refund. Well, you don't have to call the guy this time. You just have to adjust the dish till the signal clears up. Which is what the guy will do on Monday. But Jake is coming tonight. Do you really want to listen to him complain about the TV all weekend. I can deal with Jake. It's your whining that makes me want to hang myself. Come on. Help me get the ladder. I'll go up on the roof, and we'll fix it in five minutes. I have a ladder. How did I get a ladder. For the life of me, I can't remember buying a ladder. Well, apparently, you did. But why? And how did I get it home. I really couldn't tell you. Did I rent a truck. Who knows. I'm telling you, we got a real mystery on our hands. Yeah. It's a puzzler. I'm going to go up and adjust the dish, and you go look at the TV and tell me when the picture improves. All right. I still think we should call the guy. Forget the guy. I'm the guy. Charlie. Yeah?. There's a pair of panties up here. Of course. The ladder. Alan, mystery solved. What. Never mind. Focus on the job at hand. Are you watching the TV. Yes. How's it look now. It's a little better. How about now. No. That's worse. Move it the other way. What. There, there, there. That's perfect. What?. I said, that's perfect. Great! I'm coming down. [SCREAMING. Did you say something. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men... . I told you. We should have called the guy. Aw. You want to flip me the bird, but the poor little fella can't fly. Just help me lie down. There is a bright side here, you know. Oh, really? Really? And what might the bright side be. Handicapped parking. Pity s*x. Oh, I can see there's going to be no talking to you about this. Oh, oh. Do me a favor, and call Judith and tell her not to bring Jake over. How come. Look at me, Charlie. I have abrasions, contusions, a severely sprained neck, two fractured fingers, and I'm hopped up on pain pills. Does that spell "Weekend Dad" to you. Well, actually, to me, it spells "Weekend in Bangkok with two Olympic gymnasts.. But that's a whole other story. Look, I got no plans for the weekend. I could take care of Jake. Bangkok. It was the '80s. A simpler time. The dollar was strong. Come on. I was kind of looking forward to hanging out with the little knucklehead. Let him come over. But I'm not going to be able to help you. What are you going to do all weekend. I don't know. Hey, maybe I'll get a chute. We could play chutes and ladders. See, that's why I want Jake here. He has a sense of humor. Well, all right. If... if you think you can handle it. Don't worry. I got everything covered. Thank you. You're welcome. Is there anything I can do for you now. Well, I got to pee. Yeah. So. So I can't undo my pants or... anything. Where are we headed with this, Alan. You said you'd help me. I was thinking more like I could make you a sandwich. Charlie... Hey, hey, hey. I am not reaching into your pants. What am I supposed to do. Go stand in the surf. Oh, come on. Grow up. Where are you going. To the bathroom. Now, come on and unzip me. Just like that? Right to it. No dinner? No movie. Charlie. Hold on. Coming. âª Me. Ah... ah... ah-choo. Holy God. [DOORBELL RINGS. Charlie. Can you get the door. Charlie. [DOORBELL RINGS. Hang on. Charlie. Oh, great. I think I just punctured a lung. [DOORBELL RINGS. [IMITATING CHARLIE]: "Don't worry, Alan. I've got everything covered.. [DOORBELL RINGS. I'm coming. Ow. You need to start your report this weekend. Why? It's not due till next Wednesday. I have plenty of time. That's what you said last time. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. I think you're getting senile. Watch your mouth, young man. I can't watch it. It's under my nose. Uh... hello. What happened to you. Well, most recently, I was hit in the head by a door. But, before that, I was fixing the satellite dish on the roof and I kind of fell. Why didn't you just call the guy. Well, for God's sake, Alan, how do you intend to look after him this weekend. I am in excruciating pain, but I appreciate your concern. Oh. Well, you could have picked up a phone and given me a heads-up. Pick up the phone. Judith, I needed barbecue tongs to take a leak. Can you look after Jake or not. Well, Charlie said he'd look after him. Oh, like hell he will. There is no way I'm going to let your degenerate brother be responsible for my son. JAKE: Oh, sure. Don't ask me what I want. Just boss me around like you're my boss or something. Charlie will be fine. Have a good weekend. Thanks. You, too. Can we go out to dinner tonight. Do I look like I'm in any kind of shape to go to dinner. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. The answer is no. Okay. Then can we go to the video store and rent the new "Final Fantasy". Jake, I hurt myself. I'm in a lot of pain. So? When I took a soccer ball to the nads, I was in a lot of pain and all my coach said was, "Walk it off.. Well, you can't just walk this off. Not with that attitude. Hey, there he is. How's it going, buddy. My life stinks. Cheer up. You're still a kid. It's going to get much worse. Where have you been. Taking a nap. Why. I find it refreshes me. You said you were going to take care of everything. Yeah. So. So, while you were sleeping, I had to answer the door. Do you realize how petty you sound right now. Relax. Lie down. I got it covered. No, you don't. Nothing is covered. It's all coverless. Now, there's a life that stinks. So, what's on the agenda? What do you want to do. I want to go out to dinner. Yeah? Well, I want my own talk show. You'll eat what we've got. Why can't we go out. Alan, I can't deal with this. Talk to your son. That's it? You... you're done covering. Well, I didn't know he was going be impossible. Hey, don't talk about me like I'm not here. Keep yappin', and you won't be. Charlie, just take him to dinner. Why should I. 'Cause he's not going to shut up till he gets what he wants. That's true. I'll drive you crazy. Yeah? Well, do your worst. If we go out to dinner, there's nothing to clean up. We're not going out to dinner. You usually want to go out to dinner. Not tonight. You're not punishing me. You're just punishing yourself. Back off, bobblehead. Oh, come on. It'll be fun. We're not going. Why not. This conversation's over. Not if I keep talking. So where do you want to eat. Clucky's. What's Clucky's. Zesty fire-roasted chicken with Grandma Clucky's secret herbs and spices. All right. Where is it. There are several convenient locations. Like where. I don't know. I just sit in the car. Well, I've never seen a Clucky's around here. How about a pizza? No. Burgers? No. Sushi? Ech. Italian? No. Chinese. No. Clucky's? No. You're not even listening. I mean, yes. Clucky's. Well, forget it. I'm not driving all over this city hoping to stumble across a Clucky's. This isn't the Clucky's my mom takes me to. No kidding. Where are we anyway. It's called Watts. Now hurry up and finish your chicken. I like the Cajun Clucky's better. Good for you. Can I go back and get some Cajun Clucky's. No, eat what you got. But I like the Cajun Clucky's better. Then why did you order the regular Clucky's. . . . . Because I forgot I like the Cajun Clucky's. Oh, just eat the freakin' chicken. Fine. Why do you say "freakin'". I know what you mean. I'm not a little kid anymore. Eat. Don't talk, eat. 'Sup. Gotta pee. Charlie, get the tongs. Charlie?. [GROANS]: Oh, boy. [IMITATES "WILLIAM TELL OVERTURE" ]: âª Gotta pee, gotta pe. âª Gotta pee, pee, pe. âª Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee, pee, pee . âª Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee, pee, pee... âª EVELYN: Alan. I've got somebody who wants to meet you. Not a good time, Mom. Yes, I can see that. Are you all right. No, not really. Oh, my poor baby. Well, anyway, Mona, Alan. Alan, Mona. Hi, Mona. Hello. What happened to you. I was fixing the satellite dish and I fell off the roof. Oh. Why didn't you just call the guy. Want to know why I didn't call the guy. I'll tell you why I didn't call the guy. Because you don't need to call the guy. It's a simple adjustment that any idiot can do. And, yes, I know, this idiot fell off the roof but it was after I fixed it all by myself, no guy. Okay, the ice has been broken. I'll just give you Mona's number and you can call her sometime when it's more convenient. Come along, dear. Do you just stay awake nights, trying to think of new ways to embarrass me. Still gotta pee. Oh, God. Oh, what the hell. [SIGHS]: Ahh... Oh, yeah. The Cajun Clucky's is way better. I'll notify Zagat's. Hey, before stop at the video store, can we get some ice cream. Who said we're stopping at the video store. I wanna rent the new "Final Fantasy.. Yeah, well, I want my $80,000 Mercedes not to smell like chicken. But life is full of little disappointments. Okay, forget the ice cream. We'll just stop at the video store. Jake, I'm tired, I've got a headache, I just paid a hundred dollars to get my car back from the "chicken valet," and I want to go home. Please. I'm sorry, what part of "no" did you not understand. The "nnn" or the "oh". How about if we just stop in front of the store, I'll run in and get the video game and you just wait in the car. How about we stop by the video store and I just stuff you through the return slot. I wouldn't fit. Try me. Oh, come on, it'll only take a minute. Look, Jake, you might be able to bully your parents into doing whatever you want, but when I say "no," that's it. Okay. Then I guess I won't have a video game to play this weekend. Exactly. You'll find something else to do. Right. It'll just be you and me. They're all out of "Final Fantasy.. So get something else. But I want "Final Fantasy.. Are you telling me that out of this entire store, thousands of movies and video games, there's nothing here that interests you. You're not gonna like the answer. I'm having chest pains. You're giving me chest pains. I bet they have "Final Fantasy" at another store. You want a final fantasy. Close your eyes and imagine yourself flying across a freakin' video store, 'cause that's what's about to happen. Again with the "freakin'.. Excuse me, but did I hear you say you were looking for "Final Fantasy". I was about to return one. You can have it. Thanks. You're welcome. He's really something, isn't he. Oh, yeah, he's something. Question is "What?. I have a boy his age. Single mom. Single uncle. Betsy. Charlie. Jake. Nobody asked you. So, uh, Betsy, maybe we can get the boys together for a little play date sometime. I don't want a play date with some stupid kid just so you can have s*x with her. Isn't he something. Yeah. Um, well, it was nice meeting you. Bye-bye. What. Are you happy. Pretty much. You. Oy. [GROANS]: Agh. Agh. Agh. Agh. Hello. "Controlled substance. Do not exceed one pill every six hours.. Yeah, right. [GROANS. Oh, what fresh child-proof hell is this. Come on, you b*st*rd. Yes. Ow. What are we doing. I'm taking you back to your mother. [DOORBELL RINGS. Why. Why? I'll tell you why. Because you're no fun anymore. Because the whole "isn't he cute" thing is over. And I'll tell you something else: if this is a prelude to what you're gonna be like as a teenager, then we've got a serious problem. Whatever. You see? You see, right there. That attitude does not fly with me. Whatever. God, I hope that's the chicken. [DOORBELL RINGS. She's not home. Ha-ha. Do not "ha-ha" me. Never "ha-ha" me. [KNOCKING LOUDLY] Judith. Come get your kid. [BANGING. Don't hide behind the couch. I can see you, Judith. [BANGING. Ha-ha. Uh-oh. âª Me. Hey, how 'bout some ice cream. Sure. Listen, I'm sorry I lost my temper. I'm sorry you slipped in dog crap chasing me. Thank you. Now, you know that I love you, but we've gotta be clear on a couple of things. I get that you're growing up, that your body's changing, that your emotions are in flux. But the important thing you need to keep in mind is that I don't care. When you're in my house, when you're out with me and especially when we're around women, you will be adorable. Got it. Shh, I'm trying to concentrate. Don't shush me. Never shush me. Whatever. Please be the chicken. Pour me one of those, will ya. You know, mixing those pills with alcohol is a really bad idea. Not if you're trying to die. Hey, how many of those pills you got left

season	Season-03j¼zEditor: Jk2writ. Hello.... Anybody.... Big news. I'm gonna marry Mia. [WATER RUNNING] Hey, Alan. I'm in the shower. Guess what I'm gonna do with Mia. Guess what I'm already doing with Kandi. That's not fair, Alan, you have to give him a hint. He doesn't need a hint. Well, then how's he supposed to guess. Oh, well. Oh, a place to hang my wash cloth. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ah. âª Men. âª Men. Is that the price should equal three months salary. Ouch. Wonder what broad came up with that. It wasn't a broad, it was a marketing scheme dreamed up by the international diamond cartel. Probably a bunch of chicks. But at least diamonds are forever, right. Oh, yeah, forever. My ex-wife still has hers. Meanwhile, I'm wearing mismatched socks from the irregular bin. Well, Mia and I are going to go the distance... 15, maybe 20 years. That's not the distance. The distance is death. Hey, if I'm still married after 20 years, kill me. I can't believe you're doing this at all. Why not. Why shouldn't someone like me settle down with a wife and kids. Boy, I don't know where to start. That's the old Charlie you're thinking of. Oh, okay. And to whom am I speaking now. May I help you, gentlemen? Yeah. We're looking for an engagement ring. How nice. Do you have anything in mind. Ah... Nothing ostentatious. Something in a brilliant cut, perhaps with complementary baguettes. Size isn't as important as color and clarity. Well, someone knows what he wants. What can I say. He's my life. âª Men... So basically, I asked her to marry me and she said yes. Huh. What do you think about that, Jake. Good. That's it? Good. It's not good. No, it's good. That's what I said. All right, I'm full. He wears his little heart on his sleeve, doesn't he. Ah, it's my own fault. I should've known better than to talk to him at feeding time. [KNOCKING ON DOOR. Charlie, I need to speak to you. I'll be right out, Rose. Did you tell her. Of course not. Would you? No. I'll let you be my best man. You mean I'm not. Well, you're on the short list, but this could cinch it. Come on, Charlie, that woman has been obsessed with you for years. She's gonna find out about your engagement sooner or later. Let it come from you. Yeah, I guess. Besides, she has a boyfriend now. She probably won't even care. Probably not. So why won't you tell her. Because if I want my eyebrows shaved, I'll shave them myself. Hey, Rosey Rose. What's up, Rosey Rose. Gordon dumped me. Oh, damn it to hell. I know, it's awful. How could he do this. He said he couldn't be with me anymore knowing that I'm still in love with you. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Listen, Rose... there's something I have to tell you. Is it good news. I could use some good news. Well... you remember Mia. Yeah. Ugh. Don't tell me you're dating her again. No, no, no. We're not dating. Good. 'Cause I always thought she was kind of a head case. [CHUCKLING. Look, the thing is I'm gonna kind of marry her. Rose. Did you hear me. I heard you. You're going to marry Mia. So... are you okay. Sure. Why wouldn't I be okay. Well, I-I-I was afraid the news might come as a bit of a shock to you. Afraid? There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie. You're my friend. Where are you going. I have things to do. What kind of things? Things. Good-bye, Charlie. Hello, Alan. Hello. Did she just use the front door. Uh-huh. She's never used the front door before. Nuh-uh. What happened out there. Well, I-I told her I was going to marry Mia, and I think I could actually see her medication stop working. Whoa. What do you think she's going to do. The question isn't what, it's when... and how I'm going to enjoy my honeymoon with my testicles glued to my ass crack. âª Men... That's a pretty wedding gown. Oh, yeah. I could probably crawl under there during the reception and no one would have a clue. Well, you would. Stop. I don't think you'd say that. Isn't it beautiful. You know, they say you're supposed to spend three months salary, but I went four. Because I'm worth it. No, actually, I had a slow first quarter. Hey, my dad called today. He wants to take your family out for a nice dinner. Yeah, well, tell him he can have one or the other, but not both. Come on, Charlie, they're going to have to meet sooner or later. Okay, but why don't we wait for a real happy occasion. What's happier than a wedding. Well, my mother's funeral springs to mind. There'll be music, dancing, my mom will be in a box. That's a gorgeous wedding cake. It's okay. I'm not big on having the little action figures on top. They kind of creep me out. They're traditional. Hey, this is our wedding. We can do whatever we want. We don't even have to have cake. We can have... pie. A wedding pie. Well, we'll probably need more than one. You know, so everybody gets some crust. Alan, what do you think about a wedding with no cake. No cake. Where would you put the little bride and groom. I can think of one place. Charlie, if you're going to do a wedding, do it right. Thank you, Alan. You're welcome. Oh, which reminds me... I just found my old wedding folder and guess what was in it. The claim check for your manhood. As I was saying, it's all here, everything you could possibly need for your big day... From paper samples for your announcements to selected verses of romantic poetry well-suited for wedding vows. And you wonder why people think you're gay. Oh, shush. Now you're talking cake, but we are light-years away from cake. First, we have to discuss the budget, the venue, how many guests, is it going to be a sit- down dinner or a buffet. Then you need to hire a photographer and a videographer, then a florist. Have you even thought about flowers. Well, lilies are nice. Oh, lilies are perfect if the bride and groom are recently deceased. But I like lilies. Mia, we will never get through this if you don't focus. Uh, now... wedding party. Bridesmaids, what are they wearing. I suggest an unflattering style in a hideous color, because after all, this is your day. Oh, oh, and before I forget, although it's not politically correct to throw rice, if you throw birdseed, you run the risk of your wedding ending like a Hitchcock movie. What kind of pie did you have in mind. Well, look who's here, the bride of Drunkenstein. Wow, that's quite a rock. You know what we call babes with rings like that in my neighborhood. Stumpy. What are you looking at me for. Just stay out of her neighborhood. That was uncomfortable. No, sand in my urethra is uncomfortable. That meal was a freaking disaster. I'm going to stay with my family, try and calm my mother down. The miserable bitch. Your family hates me, don't they. Not just you. I'll call you later. Do you believe your future mother-in-law. Shows up at a four-star restaurant wearing a track suit with the word "juicy" stretched across her half-acre ass. I can read, Mom. Can we go back? I forgot my doggie bag. We can never go back, Jake. Oh, come on, it's not the end of the world. Easy for you to say, you're not marrying into the Addams family. Oh, like you were a prize. Slipping a prenuptial agreement into my fiancee's menu?. I am just trying to protect you from being wiped out by a vindictive ex-wife who will use your hard-earned money to finance her frivolous life of partying and shopping and unnecessary plastic surgery. Um, Mom.... Every one of my surgeries was necessary. And if I had signed a prenup, you would never have gone to music camp... and Alan would have an overbite you could use to open a can of Pennzoil. I didn't know Mia's last name was Addams. I didn't know her sister's a cop. Was a cop. Now she's a dry drunk with a grudge and a .38. Well, I liked her. Well, that's because she had the same haircut as you. I was a little shocked that her father stuck you with the bill. You know why you noticed that. Because the two of you practically trampled each other trying to get to the men's room when you saw the waiter bringing it. I drank a lot of iced tea. Well, I had a very nice time. Sure. You got to inform my bride-to-be and her entire family that you had s*x with me before you had s*x with him. I was just telling Mia I know how lucky she is. Nevertheless, honey, it was not an appropriate toast. Juicy-pants almost choked to death on her lamb shank. Well, in all fairness, the woman was stuffing her face like a musket. All I can say is, after tonight's little fiasco, I'm going to have to completely rethink the seating chart for the wedding. Yeah, well, it won't be that complicated. Why not. Because none of you are invited. âª Men... Well, Mom, if you wear an animal-print track suit to a nice restaurant, people are gonna make comments. I agree. Calling you "a cougar with arm fat" was over the line. [KNOCKING. Hang on. Hello, Mia. I'll call you back. âª Men... You don't think Mia's gonna turn into her mother, do you. I wouldn't worry about it. Yeah. What I would worry about is you turning her into our mother. Thanks for ruining my wedding night, Dr. Freud. Hey, hey, don't set the bar too high for the wedding night. What're you talking about. Well, it's a long, stressful day. You'll be exhausted, full of banquet food and cheap champagne. Take my advice. Tell her you love her, give her a big kiss and try to fall asleep with your ass pointed toward an open window. You, sir, have the heart of a poet. I am merely the voice of smelly experience. Well, let me ask you this. I know things didn't end well with you and Judith, but overall, did you, did you like being married. Oh, I loved being married. You never missed having s*x with other women. Sure. But I missed that before I got married, too. What I loved was the idea of having someone that I could always turn to, someone who, who, who cared about me, someone who'd always stand by me through thick and thin. It does sound nice. Yeah. So does Disneyland. Yet every day people stagger off those giant tea cups covered in vomit. But you'd... you'd do it again. What can I say. Marriage is a great ride... till you puke. Good night. . . . . Good night. [KNOCKING. MIA: Charlie!. Mia. Your friend Rose was just at my apartment. Ohh... So, how'd that go. She was wearing a bridal gown. She's planning on wearing it to our wedding and she wanted me to know so we wouldn't clash. Well, that's kinda thoughtful, isn't it. I'm not finished. She wanted to give me a shower. An engagement shower. An actual soap- and-water shower. Ohh... I don't want her at my wedding. Hey, I don't want her in my zip code. But she's a close friend. Charlie. All right, all right, all right. I'll tell you what... I'll cross Rose off the guest list if you dump that pistol- packin' hermaphrodite you call a sister. She's my maid of honor, the gun is registered and she's taking hormones. While we're pruning the guest list, what about your mother. Done. She's out. Now your mother. It's not the same thing. You would've thrown your mother overboard for free. I don't care. If she goes, somebody on your side's gotta go. How about your father. He takes us all out to dinner and the only plastic he's got on him is his shoes. Charlie, he has to give me away at the wedding. Give you away. That cheapskate. I'll probably have to trade him a pony and a couple of blankets for you. So what are we saying. That we're gonna have a wedding that none of our family and friends can attend. We might as well just go to Vegas and elope. Now there's an interesting concept. In Vegas, not only could we get married immediately, we can get drunk and gamble away our nest egg. Don't forget the lap dances and hookers. Oh, you're gonna make a great wife. âª Men... All the wonderful plans I had for a wedding... Let it go, Alan. I don't understand the big rush. You wouldn't even stop for boutonnieres. I just wanna get this over with. Get this over with. That's the attitude you take to a proctologist, not a marriage. Well, maybe I'm just a little nervous. Is that all it is. What are you saying. I'm saying that if you're feeling uneasy, maybe you're not ready for this. Did you have doubts when you got married. None. Judith assured me I was doing the right thing. KANDI: âª Here comes the bride . âª Here comes the brid. âª Here comes the bri-ide, here comes the bride. âª That's all I got. Hi. Wow. You look beautiful. Thanks. I was afraid you were gonna chicken out. That's funny. She said the same thing about you. Thank you, Kandi. So, are you sure this is what you really want to do. I'm sure. Are you. Absolutely. MAN: Okay. Who's the lucky couple. Well, we're the ones getting married, so I guess it's them. Charlie. I joke. MINISTER: All righty. Now, before we begin the ceremony, I need both your signatures there and there. Okay. So, are you folks staying in Vegas, or are you honeymooning somewhere else. I don't know. What do you think, sweetie. Oh, uh... can I talk to you for a second. What'd I say? Am I in trouble already. I swear to God, I think we're the lucky couple. Charlie, relax, I just want to talk to you about our honeymoon. Oh. I'll take you anywhere you wanna go. Frankly, I'd pick a place with a nice ceiling, 'cause we're just gonna take turns looking at it. Charlie, I'd love to honeymoon with you, but, well, I have to work and, well, I think it'd be smarter to use the money to redo the house. Oh, I get it. You gave up trying to change me so now the house has to suffer. If we're gonna have a family, we'll need to turn the second bedroom into a nursery. But that's, that's where Jake stays. Yeah, but once Alan moves out then Jake won't be staying there anymore, right. Alan's moving out. Of course he is. Isn't he. This is so romantic. When I was a little girl, I used to love playing bride. Me, too. I-I mean, I mean, I was the groom. Most of the time. You think you'll ever get married again. I don't know. I hope so. You should, 'cause you'd make a good husband. You're kind, considerate, dependable and you're cuter than a duck wearing a hat. Come on, Charlie. We need our privacy. But they're my family. I can't just kick 'em out. Well, you could've said something before now. Who knew your idea of marriage was you and me alone in a house. I don't believe this. As long as I've known you, you've been complaining about Alan living with you. And you want to take that away from me. You know what? I thought you were ready to grow up, but clearly I was wrong. What's more grown up than wanting to take care of my family. And let's not forget, you're the one who came back to me. I only came back to you because I wanted your sperm. Yeah, well, it's a package deal. My sperm and my brother go hand in hand. Kandi, this is so sudden. I know. But lots of good things are sudden. Like sun showers... orgasms... That's two things. Multiple orgasms. That's five. All right, deal's off. Let's get the hell outta here. Hang on. Are you really serious about this. You love me, I love you, the s*x is great. The s*x is unbelievable. Wait, what'd you say. I said the wedding's off. Oh my God, what happened. It doesn't matter. What's important is I just avoided making a huge mistake. Charlie, I am so sorry. Oh, thanks. Now let's head for a strip joint, get drunk and let the healing begin. Uh, yeah, but, but, before we do that, I was wondering, uh, could I ask you for a little favor. Yeah. Can I borrow your wedding ring. What for. Well, I thought as long as we're in Vegas, I'd marry Kandi. Are you insane. Oh, come on, you're not using it. âª Men... I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. I don't freakin' believe it. Cheer up, Charlie. You're finally getting what you always wanted. I'm moving out of your house. I don't freakin' believe it

episode20Episode-04-Your Dismissive Attitude Toward BoobsjyEditor: Jk2writ. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... What are you doing. Masticating. What. Don't worry, it doesn't mean what you think. And what do you think I think. You know... Okay, I know what I know. What do you know. I know that you're supposed to masticate your foo. 20 times before you swallow. Yeah, but, uh, what about the other thing. What other thing. The thing you thought I was thinking. I'm sorry, Dad. You lost me. Morning. Oh, morning. Isn't this your day off. It is, but I need to talk to Charlie. Well, good luck. He got home an hour ago, had a bowl of chili, threw up and went to bed. He probably threw up 'cause he didn't masticate enough. Hey, pottymouth, there's a lady present. Berta, why don't you tell me what you need, and then you can go enjoy your day off by spreading sunshine and cheer to others. It's about the house. I should wait for Charlie. I live here, too. What's the problem. I'll wait. Oh, for God's sake, pretend I'm Charlie. Talk to me. Okay. Hey, Charlie, I've thought it over, and if you want me to kill your brother, I'll need the cash up front. Very amusing. Thanks. I've been taking an improv class. Okay, here's the deal. I got five brothers and sisters. I'm the middle child, which probably explains why I'm such a people pleaser. Uh-huh. Anyhow, my brother Philip... He's the second oldest... He's in the roadside fireworks business, which is, as you might expect, seasonal. Now, this creates a lot of economic uncertainty which has strained his marriage. Perhaps not as much as him boinking his wife's half-sister... ...but it's a snowball effect. Anyway, to make a long story short... Too late. Fair enough. BERTA: 1; Zippy: 1. Anyway, Philip can't live at his house because, technically, it's a crime scene. Which is why I wanted to ask Charlie... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You, uh, you want your brother to stay here. Oh, don't be stupid. He's staying at my place trying to wean himself off the meth and the codeine and whatnot. I want to stay here for a couple of days. Oh. Oh, um... That's okay. I'll ask Charlie. No, you don't have to ask Charlie. You-you can ask me. Fine. Oh, you'd like an answer now. That'd be swell. Ah, ah, well, uh, uh, I-I would have to say, um... uh, after due consideration and, uh, and, uh, uh, taking into account all the, uh, uh, factors that are-are involved that... It would be our pleasure to have you. Super. Do you mind if I take your room. M-M-My room? Gee, I-I... Trust me. You want me to have a room with a private crapper. Okay. By all means. Take my room. I'll bunk with Jake. Thanks. What do you mean, you'll bunk with Jake. Is that a problem. Yes. I need my privacy. For what. You know... âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Men. Never again. Never, ever, ever again. You gonna quit drinkin'. Don't be ridiculous. I'm gonna quit wakin' up. What are you doing here. Isn't this your day off. It is, but your brother invited me to be your houseguest for a couple of days. Did he now. Well, I was going to ask you, but Alan said he could speak for both of you. Did he now. You got a problem with that. Don't be silly. You're like family. Yeah, well, I've seen how you treat family. Hey, you're always welcome here. You don't even have to ask. Morning, Alan. ALAN: Hey, look who finally... [SMACKING SOUND] ALAN: Ow. Berta? Living here. Are you insane. She needed a place to stay for a couple of days. What would you have said. I would have sat her down and explained my sincere belief that there are boundaries between employer and employee which exist specifically to protect said employer from accidentally seeing the employee prancing around in her big cotton granny-panties. All right. Go tell her that. Okay, I was bluffing. Look, look, it's just for a couple of days. We can tough it out. Yeah, but we wouldn't have to tough it out if you hadn't presumed to invite someone to stay at my house without my permission. Hey, hey, I live here, too. So do termites. They don't have guest-inviting privileges either. You're equating me with termites. Hell, no. You can get rid of termites. You know, if I thought you meant that, I would be really hurt. Too subtle. Okay, let me take another tack. Alan, do you know why I've never accepted any money from you to stay here. Well, I assumed you were being compassionate and generous during a difficult period in my life. Oh... [BLOWS RASPBERRY. It's so you can be here and Jake can be here, but it remains my house, not our house. What's the difference. In my house, what you think, what you want, what you say doesn't mean squat. It's just jibber-jabber. So... so you're saying I have no rights here. I thought that was understood. I can't believe we're even talking about it. Incredible. I've been living here for two years, and you still consider me a houseguest. No. My houseguests bring a bottle of wine and have s*x with me. Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go get some chardonnay and assume the position. Hey, don't be letting your mouth write checks your ass can't cash. [UNDER BREATH]: Pompous jerk. I don't know how you put up with that. Y-Y-You heard. Uh, we were whispering. Must be one of them acoustical anomalies. I just think it's criminal the way Charlie treats you... Like some kind of second-class citizen. Second-class. I aspire to second-class. You know what the pecking order is in this house. Charlie, women Charlie sleeps with, Charlie's bookie, women Charlie hopes to sleep with, termites, me. Well, that's just not right. Yeah, but what am I supposed to do. I-I-I can't really afford my own place. I mean, I could, but it certainly wouldn't be on the beach... unless the beach was Guadalcanal. It's a shame, you paying all that money for an ex-wife and an ex-wife's house, and you're not allowed inside either one. Exactly. I'm a victim here. Oh, yeah. You got "victim" written all over you. But does my brother sympathize. Do Catholic priests make good baby-sitters. Listen, you want rights and privileges, you got to demand them. Stand up to Charlie. Get in his face. You know what. You're right. And starting now. Go get him, tiger. Come here, Charlie. I want to... [SLAP] ALAN: Ow. âª Men. Oh, that is so wrong. Hey. Hey. You know, Charlie, you've really got a beautiful view here. You're just noticing that. Well, I spend most of my days looking at dirty toilets and those Rorschach tests you call bedsheets. Oh. Well, it's nice you're getting a chance to stop and smell the roses. Oh, don't get me started on the smells around here. Hey, listen, Berta, you know, you know how I feel about you, right. No, tell me. Oh, gee, I could never put it into words. Well... then show me. Relax, I'm just screwin' with you. [CHUCKLING. Good one. Anyway, uh... I believe there are certain boundaries between an employer and an employee... which is why I think it'd be best if you found... Oh, I agree with you about the boundaries... ...which is why I've been keeping quiet about the things your brother says behind your back. What does he say. Oh, I don't want to cause problems. No, no, no, come on, tell me. Well, let's just say that he doesn't always appreciate everything you do for him. You know what the problem is. I'm a soft touch. You do have a big heart, and there are always people out there who will take advantage of that. You just wouldn't think it'd be your own brother. Yeah, that's the saddest part. But what can I do about it. Respect's not freely given in this life, Charlie. You got to demand it. You're right. It's time for me to stand up for myself. Good for you. And while you're up, would you get me one of those little Japanese beers you keep in the refrigerator. Oh, sure. Be right back. Thanks. I'm a baaad pussycat. âª Men. Did you know your body doesn't digest corn. It goes out the same way it comes in. It's like a little bookmark in your poop. Did they teach you that in school. Nope. It's the powers of observation. ALAN: Jake, that's not dinner conversation. You're right. It's dinner cornversation. See what happens when you don't hit your kids. Hey, something smells good. Meat loaf. Great, I love meat loaf. Well, you should make some. I'll give you the recipe. You didn't make enough for me. I'm not your chef. Is that so. How did you cook the meat loaf. In the oven. Aha. My oven. What's your point. My point. Uh... Oh, don't put me in the middle. I love you both. My point is, I'm hungry, and I want meat loaf. Yeah, well, I'm Alan, and I want respect. I think I got a better chance at gettin' meat loaf. You know what, Charlie. I'm starting to feel like maybe Jake and I have overstayed our welcome. No, not at all. Jake's still welcome. You're the one with the attitude. My attitude. I-I thought my attitude didn't count for anything. That it was just... jabberwocky. Jibber-jabber, you moron. Okay, okay, that settles it. I think it's time we moved. We. Yeah, we. But I'm still welcome. You'll go where I go. Can we get a place on the beach. Sure, if you don't mind living under a lifeguard stand. Hey, we managed to get by without your help before we came here, we'll do it again. Why do you keep saying "we". You know what your problem is. You just don't appreciate all the things I do for you. Yeah, well, I'm tired of being treated like a second-class citizen. Fine. You want to leave, leave. Maybe I will. Way to stand up for yourself. Thank you. So, are we really out of meat loaf, or were you just saying that to piss him off. âª Men. Oh, this looks interesting. "Two-bedroom. Needs work. Up-and-coming neighborhood.. What-What does that mean, uh, "Up-and-coming neighborhood?. It means the Realtor didn't think he could move the house saying, "Drug-ravaged battlefield.. Okay, we'll keep looking. Alan, I don't mean to pry, but after alimony and child support, exactly how much can you afford to spend. Really. Yes, really. Sweetie, my shoes cost more than this. Well, Mom, you have a lot of shoes. The ones I'm wearing. Alan, based on this amount, you don't need a Realtor. You need someone who sells camping equipment. Yeah, well, then that's what I'll do. All right, but may I propose a simple alternative. I'm not living with you, Mom. Okay. Well, then I have a final alternative. And what would that be. Run straight to your brother's ass, and kiss it repeatedly. Forget it. I-I can't stay here anymore. Hey, Red, you want to top this off for me. Certainly. May I get you a short stack and some pork links while I'm at it. Nah, I'm full. But as long as we're discussing dining choices, why don't you bite me. Oh, goodie. More loved ones. Good morning, Charlie. Let me guess. Alan invited you to move in. No. She's helping me move out. This is a sad day. We're gonna miss you around here, Alan. Well, thank you, Berta. Sad, sad, sad. . . . . Don't you have anything to say, Charlie. Yeah. Boo-hoo. Okay, well, enough of sentiment. We should really get going. Apartments in your price range are a long drive from Malibu. I know, Mom. A long, long drive. Got it. Maybe you should try to go pee-pee before we get in the car. Okay. Would you mind looking after Jake. If it'll help get you out of here, I'll breast-feed him. You know, with Zippy out of here, you're gonna have that nice guest room just going to waste. Yeah. So, I was thinking, how about if I become a live-in. A live-in what. Housekeeper. Easier for you, easier for me. Everybody wins. Gee, um... Hold that thought. My coffee just kicked in. [KNOCKING. Hey, you want to go down to the arcade and play some air hockey. No. Want to go to a movie. No. Come on, I'll take you to something R-rated. See some boobs. Just leave me alone. Are you mad at me. What was your first clue. Well, frankly, your dismissive attitude toward boobs. Why are you making us move. You're not moving. Well, then why is Dad looking for another place for us to live. Because he's trying to teach me a lesson. Why don't you tell him to stop. Because I'm trying to teach him a lesson. What's your lesson. That it's my house. What's his lesson. That he lives here, too. Okay, I'm just a kid, but that sounds stupid even to me. Well, be that as it may, I give you my word, I am not gonna let you go anywhere. Promise. Promise. Is the boob offer still open. Come on. âª Men. How do you pronounce her last name. Hayek. Salma Hayek. Wow. Her name's as pretty as her boobs. Hey. Hey. What's all this. Found a place. Fully furnished, ready to move in. Uh, Jake, I packed most of your stuff. You may want to check if I missed anything. Uncle Charlie.... Listen to your father. But you said... I said listen to your father. [SIGHS. I'm just a pawn. So, where is this place. In the Valley. A lovely, uh, Spanish-style complex called Valley Hacienda. Good for you. Two-bedroom. Pool, Jacuzzi, rec room. Sounds great. It is, and we're going. I can see that. Well, it's for the best. I'll finally have a place that's really mine, and you can go back to living the selfish, unexamined life you obviously cherish. Looking forward to it. Okay, I guess I'm ready to go. Well, then, uh, I guess we should go. Need some help. No, we can handle it. All right, uh, Valley Hacienda, here we come. Jake, say good-bye to your Uncle Charlie. Bye, Uncle Charlie. Bye, kid. Jake, go get in the car. Listen to your father. I don't think anybody's learning anything here. Well, uh, thanks for your hospitality. I'm sorry we overstayed our welcome. Alan... I don't want to go. Please don't make me go. I love it here. I love it so much. I thought you found a nice place. I was bluffing. It sucked. They all sucked. Do you want me to kiss your ass. 'Cause I will literally kiss your ass. Come on. Turn around. Alan, cut it out. I mean it, I mean it. You're the boss. You know, I'd-I'd rather be a second-class citizen here in paradise than king of a urine-soaked firetrap next to Burbank Airport. Alan, Alan, calm down, calm down. If you want to stay, you can stay. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Oh, Charlie, you have no idea how bad it was. I mean, I couldn't bring a woman to one of these places. The only way I'd ever have s*x was if I was molested by a rat. Pull yourself together. [SNIFFLING. Now go grab Jake, and we'll all have some dinner. Okay, okay. And-And thanks again. You're welcome. [SNIFFLING. Hey, hey, Charlie. What. Just before I-I went down on my knees... were you about to say something. I don't think so. Before I started weeping, you were gonna tell me to stay. No, I wasn't. Okay, you're not fooling anybody. You'd miss me if I was gone. Despite everything you've said, we're brothers, and we have a bond that's deeper and more meaningful than any... He folded, didn't he. My ass is covered with lip-prints. Damn. Well, anyway, uh, I guess you want to head home and see how Philip's doing. Who. Philip. Your brother. Detoxing. Oh, yeah, sure. Philip. My brother. This isn't so bad. Seems reasonably safe. Oh, yeah. I'm sure the Valley Hacienda crack dealers have organized some sort of neighborhood watch. We could make this work. I-I think it's got a lot going for it. [JET ENGINE ROARING LOUDLY. I'm not a big fan of the orange carpet, um, but part of the fun of having a new place is fixing it up, making it your own. [JET ENGINE ROARING] You know, slap on a new coat of paint... [ROARING CONTINUES. ...some fresh linoleum on the kitchen floor. Of course, a little bleach to take out those bloodstains in the tub. Or you could just run home and kiss your brother's ass repeatedly. Couldn't you just say, "I told you so?

showTwo-And-Half-MenjæiEditor: Jk2writ. Alan, do you ever fantasize when we're making love. Well, occasionally, I pretend that I'm better-looking. What about you. Sometimes I imagine we're in the middle of a big department store. Ha... having s*x. No. Shopping. Why would I fantasize about having s*x while I'm having s*x. Do you think about ham and cheese when you're eating a sandwich. Can't argue with that. What ya thinkin'. Well, nothing, really. I... I just... I got a call from Jake's school today. Huh. You know who called me. Jessica Murray. Oh? Who's that. A friend of mine. Yeah. Well, anyway, Jake's mom and I have to go to a parent-teacher conference tomorrow, and I don't really know what it's about. Huh. Hey, do you ever pretend your toes are little people. What? No. Sometimes I make believe they're different families playing Family Feud. All right, let's meet our champions. He goes to market, she stays home. Please welcome the Piggie family. Hi, everybody. You're goin' down, Piggie Family. You're goin' down. Hey. Hey. How's it goin'. Forget it, Alan. I only do the aprÃ©s s*x chat with people I've just had s*x with. Come on. She's playing Family Feud with her toes. I don't care if she's playing banjo with her nipples. But I need to communicate after lovemaking. I-I need to share. Well, maybe you should have thought of that before you started boinkin' a girl with the IQ of Tickle Me Elmo. Fine. Hey, Berta. How's it goin'. Back off, Zippy. If you want pillow talk, you gotta spoon me first. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ah... âª Men. But I think we all agree that ship has pretty much sailed. So why did you want to see us. Well, I'm concerned that, even outside of the classroom, Jake has no interest in anything that goes on around here. Now, hang on. He speaks very highly of your hot lunch program. Well, I was talking more about hobbies or extracurricular activities. Well, I don't know about his father, but I've tried to share some of my interests with him. Unfortunately, he's a little young to drink in the dark and bitch about men. [SNICKERING. You know... I was kind of lacking in focus when I was his age, too, until I got bit by the ol' theater bug. Too bad you didn't get bit by the ol' rabid squirrel. You know, I'm organizing a drama club. Would that be something that Jake would have any interest in, or do you think he gets enough drama at home. All the world's a stage. And we are merely players. [LAUGHING. Ooh. Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. Did she say what I was in trouble for. No. Boy, it's the not knowing that drives you crazy. Yeah, like a pregnancy test. Yep. I don't get it. [COIN JINGLING. Yes. In your face, Opie. This game stinks. No, you stink at it. That was my lunch money. Aw, your lunch money. Why didn't you tell me. âª Boo freakin' hoo... Pack a sandwich. âª Okay, Jake, we talked to Miss Sheffield... I'm sorry. What are you sorry about. I'm... I'm sorry I interrupted you. Go ahead. Well, we thought it would be a good idea if you got involved in some extracurricular activities. Oh. Okay. Great, great, we'll talk about it at home. Do you even know what an extracurricular activity is. Who cares? I'm off the hook. âª Men... âª I... am the very model of a modern major general . âª I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral . âª I know the kings of England, . âª And I quote the fights historical . âª From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical. âª What do you think. What was this all about. It's choreography. It's gay. Okay, you know, forget about the movements. Just try singing the song. No. Why not. Because it's gay. Don't encourage him. Don't make him sing Gilbert and Sullivan. He needs something to audition for the school musical. You teach him a song. Why don't you let him choose. Jake, why don't you tell your uncle what you wanted to sing. It's called "Whoop That Stanky Ho.. All right, there's got to be some middle ground here. You like classic rock, right? Yeah. Okay, well, pick a band. Um... how about Queen. Oh, good, I was afraid he was gonna pick something gay. [PLAYING INTRO OF "BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY". âª I see a little silhouetto of a man . âª Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango? . âª Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me . [FALSETTO, THEN TENOR]: âª Galileo, Galile. âª Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Figaro magnifico... . [STOPS PLAYING. It doesn't sound right. You heard it, too, huh. You sure you're playing all the right notes. Yes, I'm sure. Well, it doesn't sound anything like Queen's version. No, it doesn't. Why don't you work on it. We'll try again tomorrow. Yeah, why don't I do that. Kid's a double threat... tone-deaf and arrogant. Hey. Where have you been. Kandi called looking for you. Oh, I had to work late. Oh. Yeah, one of my regular patients had, uh, a crisis. His name is Roger. He had a couple of vertebrae pinching a nerve. Too bad. Nice guy, you'd like him. He restores old cars. Well, it's actually more of a hobby than a job. He works at Staples. His name is Roger. Alan? Yeah. Why are you lying to me. I don't know. I really suck at it. You do, indeed. Don't you care where I was. Why would I start now. Oh, come on, I really need to get this off my chest. [SIGHS. All right, go ahead. I was with another woman. Okay, see, that's a good lie. No, no, I really was with another woman. Seriously. You're already doing a hot 22-year-old, and you're cheating on her. Yes. I am so proud of you. What. Who's the dog? My brother's the dog. [HOWLING. Come on, dog, come on, dog, howl with me. [HOWLING. [HOWLING. Now, stop howling, and let me explain. There's nothing to explain. You're sleeping with two women at the same time. You're a big ol' dog! [HOWLS. I haven't been sleeping with the other woman. [HOWLS INQUISITIVELY. I've been seeing Jake's teacher. [HOWLS INQUISITIVELY. All we do is talk. [HOWLS WEAKLY. I don't know how to explain it, we just have so much in common. I mean, she's divorced, she has a kid Jake's age, she reads, she likes the theater... Yeah, yeah, but you're not sleeping with her. Why would I sleep with her when I've got Kandi. I don't know... 'cause you can. It's not that kind of relationship. It's-it's intellectual. So? Take her to a museum, enjoy the exhibits, and do her in the restroom. You're missing the point. No, no, no, no. You're missing the point. If you're not getting laid, it's not cheating. Then why do I feel so guilty. Well, that's easy... 'cause you're an idiot. I guess I just always thought that one woman was supposed to fulfill all my needs. Oh, that's an old wives' tale, started to protect the interests of, you guessed it, old wives. So you're saying the whole concept of monogamy is a fraud. The institution of marriage is a sham. No, no, no. I'm just saying bang the teacher. Why does he make everything so complicated. âª Men... There we go. "Blunderbuss.. Oh, oh... Very elegant use of my "under.. Thank you. Oh, boy. [DOORBELL RINGS. I have more vowels than a Honolulu phone book. You're so clever, Alan. Thank you. You am smart, too. Hey, Alan, can I talk to you for a sec. Oh, sure. Excuse me. Hurry back. What's up. You tell me. Nothing, we're just playing Scrabble. And you know what, I decided you're right. There's absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. Good to know. 'Cause Kandi's here. Oh, okay. Um... It's not a problem. Uh, uh, uh, here's what we do. We. Come on, work with me. You go cover for me with Kandi and I'll get Francine the hell outta here. But I thought there was nothing to feel guilty about. Yeah, yeah, you know that and I know that. Now, go lie to Kandi about it. Fine, I'll tell her you went to Staples to see Roger. Who. Hey, why don't we go take a walk on the beach. What about the game. Screw the game. I concede. You win. Well played. All right. It is a beautiful night. Yeah, yeah, let's go enjoy it on the beach. Come on. Chop chop. Kandi. Wha.... Alan must've slipped out. You're lying to me, Charlie. No, I'm not. Oh, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't you wanna know where he is. Where who is. Alan. Sure, why not. All right, the truth is... Alan is out trying to find the perfect gift for you. Really? Yes. He wants to surprise you with something extremely expensive. Ooh. Can you give me a hint. Well, let's see... it's something that's a girl's best friend and looks good wrapped around their neck. I'm getting a monkey. No, no, it's... Oh, good Lord. A diamond necklace. Oh, that's nice, too. Just remember, you didn't hear it from me. Then who'd I hear it from. Nobody. When he gives it to you, act surprised. Don't worry, I'll be really surprised. Good, good, good. So will he. [SLOW PIANO CHORDS PLAYING. [TUNELESSLY]: âª Nothing really matter. âª Anyone can se. âª Nothing reall. âª Matter. âª Nothing really matter. âª To me. . . . . That's... that's... that's terrific. Wanna hear it again. No. W-We don't wanna strain your voice. You think I'm gonna do okay at the audition. Well, you never know how these things are gonna go. Yeah. Just hope I have a decent piano player. I thought you were working with him. What's the problem. Okay, there's a technical term we musicians use. Jake... stinks. Is there anything we can do. We can hope "stinks" suddenly becomes popular, but I wouldn't count on it. Oh, by the way, you need to buy Kandi a diamond necklace. Wh-what. You told me to cover for you. I said you were out buying her jewelry. That's all you could think of. Well, I could think of a lot of things, but only one made me laugh. I can't afford to buy her jewelry. I know. That's what makes it funny. âª Men... It must've been so expensive. Yeah. You do realize this entitles you to extra special bonus s*x. What is extra special bonus s*x. It's whatever you want it to be. That sounds like fun. [KNOCKING AT DOOR. Go away. CHARLIE: Okay. I'll just play Scrabble till you're ready. Give me a sec. Please don't tell me Francine is here. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Francine is here. Yeah, you want me to cover for you. Yes. I'm on it. Wait. Charlie, I'm begging you, no more jewelry. Don't worry, it's not funny twice. Sorry, he must've gone out. Oh, okay. Tell him I stopped by. Francine, wait. I can't do this. Do what. I'm not a good liar. I know where he is, I'm just not supposed to tell you. Well, the thing is, Alan does a lot of charity work. Really? Oh, yeah. Right now, for instance, he's down at the nursing home giving sponge baths to old people. They don't go out a lot, so they tend to get dusty. I had no idea. In fact, just the other night, he was down on Skid Row teaching salsa dancing to crack addicts. Oh, my goodness. They have the energy, they just lack the focus. But I think... I think what he's proudest of is his work with the kids. He takes runaways who've been forced to live on the streets and teaches them how to live in the woods. I don't really see the point, but those little urchins seem to thrive in the wild. It's like he's a saint. You must be so proud to have him as your brother. Well, truth be told, he does bring me a lot of joy. Thank you for telling me this, Charlie. You're welcome. Just promise me you won't embarrass him by bringing it up. Oh, not a word. I just hope I can be worthy of him. [TO HIMSELF]: And the plot moistens. âª Men... Well, that's terrific, buddy. I'm so proud of you. Yeah, sure, I'll tell him. All right, love ya. Bye-bye. Guess what. Jake just got the lead in the school musical. The lead. What happened, did every other kid in school get mono. No, I think it was Francine. I think she cast Jake because of our relationship. You mean it's gotten physical. You're sleeping his way to the top. No, no, nothing happened between us. But I think she's fallen for me. Really. What makes you think that. Well, I had lunch with her today and she was looking at me with, I don't know, worship in her eyes... like I was. Some kind of... Saint? Yes! Yes. How'd you know. Well, that's how I think of you. Very funny. But look, I've been doing my best not to lead her on, but I guess I just underestimated my allure. Say that again. What. That last part. You mean... I underestimated my allure. Yeah, that's it. I'm sorry, am I missing something. No, not a thing. Well, good. You see, Alan? That's how you lie. âª Men... Pretty exciting, huh? Opening night. Well, having seen the previews, I'm betting closing night, too. Boy, this brings back memories. Sixth grade was the happiest two years of my life. Oh... it's the finger. So, Kandi, what's your favorite musical. The trombone. I can't believe you brought her here. I had to. Jake invited her. Is that a diamond necklace. You never gave me a diamond necklace. Yeah, well, you never gave me extra special bonus s*x. Hi, Charlie. Hi. Who's this. This? Oh, this is Kandi. Hi. I'm with Alan. Oh, are you one of the young people he takes care of. Yep, good old Saint Alan. Just can't do enough for the kids. Look at this diamond necklace he gave me. He gave you a diamond necklace. Don't get the wrong idea. It wasn't to get me to have s*x. Oh. I was already doing everything he wanted. I am as shocked as you are. âª Men... âª To fight the unbeatable fo. âª To bear with unbearable sorrow . âª To run where the brave dare not go . âª This is my ques. [MOUTHING. âª To follow that star, no matter how hopeless . âª No matter how fa. âª And the world will be better for this . âª That one man, scorned and covered with scars... âª What was that about. Funny story. I'll tell you later. âª To reach the unreachable staaaaaaarrrrrs! 

episode&$Episode-23-Arguments for the QuickiejÊlEditor: Jk2writ. Yo, whassup. Oh, stop it. Hey, give me back my skully. This is not a skully. It's a ski cap your grandmother gave you for Christmas. Charlie, come on. He's just trying to find his look. Word. Word. There's a reindeer on it. Don't listen to him, Jake. I think it looks very dope on you. Oh, man. Hey, did you see that your former girlfriend's dance troupe is in town. Mia's here. Let me see that. Come on. Come on. Come on. Whoa, is somebody still carrying a torch. Torch? Don't be ridiculous. I mean, I'm glad to see she's following her dream, but I've moved on. You know, I think she called the other day. What?! When?. What'd she want?! What'd she say?. Um... Come on, kid, spill it. Nope, no unresolved feelings there. She wanted to talk to you, but you weren't home. I know that, you chowderhead. What else did she say. Uh, she said, "What's new?. I said, "Nothing much.. She said, "How's school?. I said, "It sucks.. Then she said, "That's too bad.. I said, "Yeah.. I'm going to kill him, Alan. I swear to God I'm going to kill him. Oh, yeah, she wants us to come see her dance next weekend. It says she's performing this weekend. Oh, I guess she called last weekend. You're telling me this now?! Charlie, Charlie, calm down. How many things does the kid have to handle. Eat, poop, tell me who called. She said some guy named Will has tickets. Who's Will. I don't know. She said he'd call. Will's going to call. You mean the tickets are at "Will Call". I don't know. Maybe. Dear God, he's a doorstop that eats. Do me a favor. From now on, when somebody calls, write it down. I did. Where. On my homework. Okay. Where's your homework. Um... Oh, yeah. My teacher called. She wants to meet with you. When. I guess it was last week. Peace out. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men, men . âª Ooh... âª Men. Mia left us four seats for Friday night. House seats, center orchestra. Huh. What do you think. You, me, Jake, Kandi, go out to dinner make an evening of it. Sounds like fun. Maybe afterwards you could tie me to an anthill and smear honey on my genitals. So you don't want to go. Geez, now I see where the kid gets his brains. No, I don't want to go. Why would I want to go. Um, because you were in love with the woman and obviously still have feelings for her and want to see her again. Oh, that's crazy. God, you are so naive. How am I naive. Oh, oh! I know this one. Alan, when an ex-girlfriend calls, no good can come from it. Unless, you know, it's 2:00 a.m., she's blind drunk and wants to get even with her new cheating boyfriend. She just wanted to invite us to the ballet. Yeah, right. And girls are completely unaware that you can see their nipples through their shirts. What does that have.... Really? They know. There's only a few reasons why an ex calls. One: they're doing great and want to rub your nose in it, or two: they're doing lousy and need to borrow money. Or three: they've got money from knocking over a Laundromat and want to hide under your trailer until the heat's off. It happens. Okay, okay. How about four: she misses you and wants to try again. What is it she's going to try. To change me into something I'm not to get me to stop drinking, smoking, gambling. To rescue me from the barren, loveless abyss my life has become. What. You know what I think. I think you were never happier than when you were with Mia. You still have feelings for her and you're just afraid to admit it. You are so wrong. You couldn't be more wrong. Believe that guy. You want the truth. No, probably not. Good call. Oh, by the way, here's the 20 bucks I owe ya. âª Men... ALAN: I am telling you it is not appropriate to wear to the ballet. Why you trippin' on me. Hey, Alan. [GRUFFLY]: Matey. I'm not a pirate. You're not a gangsta either. You're a dorky white kid with a Cub Scout bandana on his head. Yo, hate the game, don't hate the playa. You know kids better than me. How, how long does this pimp stage last. Just ignore him. You sure you won't change your mind and come with us. Positive. Should I at least say hi to Mia for you. Say whatever you want. I'm meeting somebody at Pavlov's. Who. How would I know. I haven't met her yet. [KNOCKING. Hi, do I look okay. Perfect. Hey, no fair. You grow a rack like that, you can wear anything you want on your head. You have a house on the beach. I'd love to see it. I could take you there. Great. Then I could bring you out on my deck, we could watch the surf in the moonlight, then I could take you in my arms, kiss you. Not a big kiss. Just a little something that gives you a taste of what's to come. Well, let's go. Then I would take your hand and lead you up to my bedroom where I would slowly undress you, then lay you down on the crisp cool sheets and proceed to make wild, passionate love to you until we're both totally spent. Okay. Then in the morning, I'll bring you a cup of coffee and your car keys. Wow. Wait, my car keys. I'll promise to call you, but I never will. Then when you try to call me, you'll find that the phone number I gave you belongs to a dry cleaner in Koreatown. What. When all is said and done, you know what we'll both have? Nothing. Not even a good memory. So what do you say we do us both a favor and not go through with this whole pathetic charade. Okay. Geez, I was just trying to get laid. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING. So, Jake, the swan is dying... Can you believe.... Pardon me. Excuse me. Hey, what did I miss. I thought you weren't coming. I'm not here for Mia. I'm here to support the arts. Yikes. Look at the package on that pretty dude. Hey, good job. Eat something. Charlie. Hey, you were terrific. Thank you. I am so glad you came. Are you kidding me? I've been looking forward to this all week. Dressed like that. Well, how else would you recognize me. These are for you. Thank you. They're... beautiful. No big deal. They had 'em at the liquor store. It was either this or a stack of Lotto scratchers. I think you made the wise choice. We'll never know, will we. By the way, Alan would have come back, too, but he had to take the kids home. The kids. He's kind of adopted a young girl. Really. Well, not so much adopted as banging. So you're looking good. You, too. How you been. Great, just great. Really great. Good. No, no. No, great. And you. How have you been. Wonderful. All right, then. I'm great and you're wonderful. What the hell are we doing here. Charlie, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. Hey, Mia, who's your cute friend. This is Charlie. Charlie, Theresa. Hey. So what do you want to talk about. This really isn't the right place. Why don't I get changed and I'll stop by your house in a little while. Sure, I'll be up because you know, I'm a night person. I remember. Of course, if you come too late I could be drunk. I remember. Or there could be other women there. I remember. See you later. Whatever. Hey, can you unhook me. âª Men... [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS. What's going on. Nothing. Mia's coming over so I thought I'd... Nothing. I see. What do you mean, you see. You're right. It's too much. How's that. Well, I... You're right. She'll smell that there were candles burning, so I have to light at least one. Now what about the music. What about it. You're right. It sounds like I'm trying too hard. ["CAMPTOWN RACES" PLAYING. Better. Well... You're right. No music. Charlie. Yeah. I'm just glad you're over her. [DOORBELL RINGS. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door. Hi, Alan. Hey, Mia. You were great tonight. Thanks. Did Jake like it. He was absolutely knocked out. Charlie, Mia's here. Oh, really? Well, ask her in. All right. Won't you come in. Hi, Mia. I almost forgot you were coming. Get out. Nice to see you again. Nice to see you, too. Sit down. Make yourself at home. Place looks the same. Well, you know me. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. If it is broke, who gives a rat's ass. Can I get you a drink. No. I'm good. So am I. In fact, I'm great. Yeah. You mentioned that. Repeatedly. So, what did you want to talk about. Oh, boy, this is a hard thing to ask. You need some money. What. No. So, what. You want to get back together again. Oh, God, no. All right, then. How about a quickie for old times' sake. Please. Charlie, I think you're a terrific guy. You're smart, you're handsome, you're talented... All good arguments for the quickie. Will you let me finish. Didn't I always. Okay. Sorry. . . . . I've been thinking a lot lately about what I want out of life. I love dancing, but let's face it, I'm not getting any younger. So the time has come for me to make some tough choices. I understand completely. You do. Nah. I'm just trying to be supportive. Charlie, I came here because... Well... I want your sperm. All right. Where do you want it. Alan! Alan! Wake up! Wake up. What. Mia wants sperm. Well, don't look at me. No. She wants my sperm. She wants me to make a deposit so she can have a baby. You're kidding. Apparently, that's another one of its uses. What the hell is that. I'm not sure. Near as I can tell, she's chasing a rabbit. So why did Mia come to you. Well, it turns out her biological clock is ticking. Most of the guys she meets are ballet dancers, so, you know, slim pickin's there. And she doesn't want to wait for Mr. Right to come along. Which pretty much leaves you. Yep. I'm good genetic material, you know. Easy on the eyes. And she wants to raise the kid alone, which fits nicely into my lifestyle. Charlie, drinking, gambling and casual s*x is not a lifestyle. Look, I didn't come in here to argue with you. Look in the hedges. Look in the hedges. What. I don't know. So... so what are you... what are you gonna do. You gonna go to a sperm bank. Well, I tried to talk her into a direct deposit. You know, straight from the tap. But she really dug in her heels. And not in the good way. And you're okay with it. Well, why not? I've sent billions of soldiers out there. It's time for one of them to finally take the hill. [GROWLING. Now what. I think she caught the rabbit. Oh. Anyway, this could be my one chance to guarantee the Charlie gene lives on. You know, make sure that the double helix that is uniquely me keeps on truckin' into the future. Okay, okay, let's assume that's a good thing. One more question. Yeah. If you have no doubts about this, why did you wake me up to tell me. Well, you're my brother, and I thought you should know you're going to be an uncle. You mean, I'm going to be an uncle to a child I'll never see. Tell you what. When he turns 12, I'll track him down, bring him to live with you, and we'll see if you get your phone messages. âª Men... What do you think. Looks like pretty standard boilerplate. It basically says that once your swim team's off the bus, you're no longer the coach. All right. Let's see. Where do I sign. The ol' John Hancock, if you will. Are you sure you want to. You're giving up the rights not only to your sperm, but to any children that might result from them... it. I understand. Do you. Once you sign, Mia can do whatever she wants with it... them. She can use it, resell it, freeze it, put it on eBay... I don't care if she uses it to caulk her bathtub. Once the boys reach escape velocity, they're on their own. I see. It's out of my hands, so to speak. I get it. Okay. I'll be back in two shakes. Three, if it's cold in there. Charlie, you okay. [MAN YELLING ANGRILY IN SPANISH. Lo siento, seÃ±or. Charlie. What?. Well, you've been in there a long time. How is it going. How do you think it's going. Well, I don't know if this will help, but sometimes, when I was married, I used to pretend that I was having s*x with a completely different woman. Oh, thanks. The image of you bumping uglies with your ex-wife should really move things along. Excuse me. I was just trying to help. Yeah, well, I was just trying to have s*x with a cup. Don't think of it as a cup. Think of it as a... a polyurethane lap dancer. [THUMP ON DOOR. Hello. Charlie, I was just getting packed. Oh, right, you're heading to San Francisco. That's got to be a big ballet town. So, did you go to the sperm bank. Uh-huh. And. Not a lot of laughs in that place. I asked the receptionist if she ever takes her work home with her. Nothing. Not even a smile. Thanks for doing this. You have no idea what it means to me. Yeah, well, funny thing. Turns out it means something to me, too. What are you talking about. I tried, Mia, I really did. I tried the magazines, the movies. You can't imagine how bad p0rn acting is until you actually watch more than three, four minutes at a time. So you're saying you couldn't? You. Yeah, I know. What are the odds, huh. Well, I guess these things happen. You'll try again, and I'm sure you'll do fine. I don't think so. Why not. Well, I have some thoughts about the reason things didn't go down as planned, or, actually, up. Okay, I'm listening. As I was sitting in that little sperm cubicle, watching Assmasters 7, The Final Chapter, all I could think about was some kid of mine growing up somewhere, and-and me not having a chance to, you know, be a part of his life. I thought you were okay with that. I thought I was, too, but, as it turns out, I'm not. So, if this is something you really want to do, then you're going to have to find someone else. I see. And, by the way, Assmasters 7 is not the final chapter. They left a lot of loose ends. All right, well, I got to go. I appreciate the effort. Yeah, thanks. I think I have a rotator cuff injury. Good seeing you again, Charlie. Good seeing you, too. Let me float another idea by you. What. It's a little crazy, a little unorthodox, but if you really want a kid, this could be the solution. Charlie, I am not having s*x with you. Who said anything about having s*x. I'm asking you to marry me. There's no Charlie here. Why you stupid girls keep calling. No, listen, I don't take message. I do dry cleaning. One more time, there's no Charlie here


showTwo-And-Half-Menj±mEditor: Jk2writ. Hey, you know what I've been thinking about. What. The death penalty. Really. That's a very complex issue. So what are your thoughts. Well, if you're going to the chair, they got to give you whatever you want for your last meal, right. I guess. I'm gonna order cereal. Why. 'Cause if you keep adding milk, you can make it last forever. And they just got to wait. Okay. Let's go back a bit. Why would you be going to the chair in the first place. I don't know. My DNA shows up at a murder scene. Because it's planted by a crooked cop or maybe one of my teachers. So you'd be wrongly accused. Story of my life, Dad. Remember that water pistol incident at school. But that was your water pistol. Yes, but it wasn't my pee. Morning. Oh, hey, how was your run. Great. We made it all the way to the pier and back. Didn't we, honey. [PANTING. Yeah. Pier... back. Hey, Jake, you ever seen anybody cough up blood. No. Then pay attention. Ass. Ass. Kiss... my... sweaty... I think I'll jump in the shower. Do you want to join me. Can't. Later... maybe. All right. Well, you drink your health shake, all right. You'll feel better. Doubt it. What's in that. I don't know. Vitamins, minerals, protein... Whatever it is, it's flushing out stuff I ate in high school. Hey, do you think they let you have a last poop after your last meal. What. 'Cause as long as you're sitting on the can, technically, you're still pooping. And they got to wait. Go get dressed. If they made you hold one in, that'd be cruel and unusual punishment. You know, I am impressed with what you're doing here... Exercising, eating right, laying off the cigars and the booze... I mean, Mia has really done wonders with you. Yeah, she's an incredible woman. She is. And I'm a lucky guy. You are. So why is there this little voice in my head that keeps whispering, "Kill yourself! Do it now!". Don't worry about that. It's very common. Really? Oh, yeah. Every man who gets into a long-term, committed relationship hears that voice. Mine sounded a little like Alec Baldwin. I don't know why. Maybe it's 'cause I enjoyed him so much in that submarine movie. What was that called. Would you get to the point. Well, you have to remember that over time that voice will fade, when you realize that what you're giving up is nothing compared to what you're gaining. What exactly am I gaining. Are you kidding. You're gaining a soul mate, someone to walk down life's path with you, someone who'll always be there sharing your hopes, your joys and your sorrows. You got nothing. It's what the minister said at my wedding. Hunt for Red October. âª Men, men, men, men, manly men, men . âª Ah âª Men CHARLIE: Back in a while, honey. I'm going for a power walk. MIA: Pace yourself. CHARLIE: Don't worry. [SIGHS. This is a good pace. [DOOR OPENS. Hey. Whatcha doing. Nothing. Close the damn door. You told Mia you weren't gonna smoke or drink anymore. Yeah, well, you told your father you weren't gonna watch dirty movies on cable anymore. Don't change the subject. Mia's gonna be really pissed at you. Only if she finds out. And she doesn't have to find out. Well, I guess that depends. What, are you blackmailing me. No. I'm just saying if you don't give me 20 bucks, I'm gonna tell on you. That's blackmail. Oh. Well, then, yeah. [DOORBELL RINGS. Hi, Mom, how are you. Deeply hurt. Is this about me or Charlie. Charlie. Great. Come on in. Can you explain to me how your brother can be in a serious relationship, and not only have I not met the woman, he hasn't even bothered to tell me her name. Do you really need an explanation for that. Do you want it to be about you. Her name's Mia. She's in the kitchen. Thank you. Thank God I didn't know Anne Frank. EVELYN: Hello. Hello. [SPAGHETTI WESTERN MUSIC PLAYS. I'm Evelyn, Charlie's mother. I'm Mia, Charlie's girlfriend. So we finally meet. So we do. One question. I'm listening. Can you fix him. I'm trying. ...15, 16, 17... 18... Jake. How about a hug for your grandmommy. No, thank you. [FRUSTRATED SIGH. One, two... [HORN HONKS. What the hell are you doing?. Hey, keep it down, keep it down. Mia thinks I'm taking a power walk. This is a sad, sad day. I always figured you'd be the last guy in the world to end up whipped. I'm not whipped. I'm... considerate. Considerate. Yeah. See, I love Mia and I want her to be happy. And I happen to know she's not happy when I smoke cigars and drink and gamble and stay out all night and eat meat and sugar and grease and fat and... nap and swear and wear shorts and bowling shirts... Oh, Charlie, you're not just whipped, you're roped, saddled and gelded. They could use you to give rides at kids' birthday parties. I am not whipped. Yeah. Here, you might as well take one of these sacks since yours is empty. Hang on a second. That ain't gonna do it, Alice. What. You smell like a beer bottle that just fell out of Joe Camel's ass. Well, what am I supposed to do. Hang on, let's see if I got anything in here that might mask your stench. Oven cleaner? No. Tidy Bowl? No. How do you feel about taking a whore's bath with a hunk of bleu cheese. I'm so proud of him... he hasn't had a drop of alcohol in weeks. Well, that's one way to go. But I've found that men who drink tend to talk less and sleep more. Which, frankly, becomes increasingly desirable as the years go by. Oh, this can't be good. Hello, darling. Wonderful to see you. Hi, Mom. Have you been dusting. No, why. You reek of Lemon Pledge. You're welcome. âª Men... I'll be downstairs. MIA: No snacking, Charlie. We're going to the best vegetarian restaurant in town. Oh, boy. [IMITATES BIRD WHISTLING. [BIRD-LIKE COOING. Oh, thank God, meat. I love you, Rose. I love you, too, Charlie. And may I say, I would never try to change you the way she has. Her name's Mia. I know what her name is. I also know where she lives, her employment history, and if you want, I can get you photographs of a wet T-shirt contest she entered during spring break, 1995, at a college bar called SeÃ±or Frogs. I forgot who I'm dealing with. I also know you have to hide from her just to smoke a cigar and slam back a warm beer. What'd you do, bug my garage. Don't be paranoid. I have a long-standing arrangement with Jake. JAKE [CALLING]: Charlie, I'm ready. I'm out here. Go, go, go, go, go. Okay, I'll go. But I want you to remember one thing. What. I'm not gonna wait for you forever. How do I look. [WOLF WHISTLE. [ROSE IMITATES BIRD COOING. How's your couscous. Yummy. You know, I had quite an interesting chat with your mom today. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I know she comes on a little strong, but her heart's in the right place. If by the right place you mean in a cooler on its way to a dying man in Tennessee, then we agree. You can't possibly mean that. I suppose not. She's too selfish to donate an organ. Even one she doesn't use. That's so unfair, Charlie. You mother loves you. Really? Did she or did she not say I was a bitter disappointment. Well, she did, but... And did she or did she not say that I'm a lazy-ass schlock jingle writer who wasted 13 years of piano lessons that she paid for by marrying a series of men with large wallets and small penises. Yes, that was mentioned. But it's only natural for someone who loves you to want to see you live up to your potential. I mean, do you really want to be known as the guy who writes songs about adult diapers. Hey, it's better than being known as the guy who wears them. Charlie, we both know you can do so much more with your life. Maybe, but you got to admire my restraint. Well, come on, look how much you've accomplished just since we've been together. You're exercising regularly, you've cut way down on the drinking and you're eating right. Did you ever think you'd be able to change your life the way you have. Never. It just goes to show you can do anything you put your mind to. I smell meat. Excuse me. Your breath. It stinks of meat. Well, it-it-it could be my tongue. My tongue is meat. No, you've been eating meat. I can smell it. Maybe it's this breast of tofurkey you smell. No, I smell beef. Where would I get beef. You tell me. Well, maybe it's secondhand beef. What. You know, like secondhand smoke. Some thoughtless guy is sitting next to you eating a steak, and... Ah, screw it. I paid a slightly disturbed woman to toss a bag of bacon cheeseburgers onto the deck while you were getting dressed. Oh, Charlie. Don't "Oh, Charlie" me. I was starving. And I'll tell you another thing. My power walk was two quick beers and a half a Cuban cigar while cowering in my own garage. That's why you smelled like Lemon Pledge. Well, it certainly wasn't to bring out the natural luster of my forehead. So you've been lying to me. If by lying you mean telling you I wasn't going to do a bunch of things and then doing them anyway and lying about it, then yes, I've been lying to you. Well, I suppose I can forgive you, if you promise it'll never happen again. Oh, it'll never happen again. You know why. . . . . Because I am done with this whole charade. I'm tired of you trying to make me over into something I'm not. I'm a grown man, not a work in progress. Charlie, people are staring. Let 'em stare. You guys know what I mean. Why can't women look at a guy for who he is instead of who they can turn him into. Please, you're embarrassing me. Well, good, maybe now you know how I feel... Sitting in a restaurant eating medallions of bean curd with lawnmower sauce. Am I right. No man should have to eat anything with the word "curd" in it. You're turning into a real ass here. Well, then I'm finally living up to my potential. I'm a big ol' bourbon-soaked, cigar-huffing ass, as God in His infinite wisdom meant me to be. As He meant all men to be. You guys are disappointing God. Okay, what if a cannibal's on death row. I guess for being a cannibal. And he orders Chinese for his last meal. Does he get to eat a Chinese guy. No. What if they just electrocuted a Chinese guy and the cannibal was next. No. He'd already be cooked. Stop it. Hey. Oh, hey. Where have you been. I had a date with Mia. That was two nights ago. Yeah, well, I stopped off in Vegas on the way home. Why. Because that's where you go after you destroy a relationship. Oh, now I understand why Mia's been calling. She sounded pretty upset. I didn't tell her anything. But you'd tell Rose, wouldn't you. Hey, you just paid me once. Rose has me on something called a retainer. So what happened with Mia. No big deal. I just got tired of trying to be something I'm not. A decent, healthy human being. Pretty much. He's back. You're damn right, I'm back. Mia and I are through. You schmuck. She was the best thing that ever happened to you. But you said I was whipped. I didn't mean dump her. I meant grow a pair. What is "whipped.. It's when a man lets a woman take over his life and tell him what to do. Oh, so like you and Mom. [PHONE RINGS. No. Oh, hi, Mother. Uh, no, no, Mia's not here. He, uh, broke up with her. Yeah, schmuck seems to be the general consensus. What's a schmuck. Any guy who's not whipped. She wants to talk to you. Well, I don't want to talk to her. Nice catch, schmuck. Hey, Mom. Whoa, whoa, whoa, why am I the bad guy here. Well, did you ever stop to consider that maybe this wasn't my fault. I got to go, Mom. My meat connection's here. I just think if the guy's got a front door, we should use it. This is fine. Hi, Charlie. Hello, Rose. What's going on. Well, I just wanted to introduce you to Gordon, my new boyfriend. Oh, no kidding. Hiya, Gordon. Hello. Gordon and I are in a committed relationship. Right, Gordon? Um, yeah, I guess. Look, see? There's stairs right over there. Just... Anyway, I was thinking that perhaps you and Mia would like to join us for dinner one night. You know, double date. Oh, well, that's nice, Rose, but I broke up with Mia. Oh, I see. Well, then, good-bye Gordon. âª Men. [TV PLAYING. I think I made a big mistake. I know the feeling. I once ate an egg salad sandwich I left in my desk over the weekend. Huge mistake. My relationship with Mia was the best thing that ever happened to me, and I threw it away. That's what I should have done with the sandwich. I wonder if it's too late to fix things. Call her and find out. Yeah, but if I do, I'll be right back where I started, trying to be somebody I'm not. Okay, then find another girlfriend. I don't want another girlfriend. I want Mia. Then call her. I can't. I can't live with her, I can't live without her. If your plane crashed in the Andes and she died, could you eat her. âª Men. Mia, it's Charlie. Look, you win. I'll change. No more meat. I promise. Come on, Mia, come out and smell me. Mia's not here. Do I have to smell you. Who are you. Ginger. So, you're Charlie. Yeah. Where's Mia. Hang on a minute. She told me to give you this if you stopped by. She took a job in New York. Why'd she do that. Just read the note. "I love you too muc. "to try to make you into something you're not, and I love me too much to settle for who you are.. That's the part that always makes me cry. I can change her mind. I'll fly to New York tonight. Do you have her address. Come on in. Can I get you something to drink. No, thanks. Yeah, hi. American Airlines reservations, please. You sure? I got all my boys here. Jack, Johnny and Jose. Maybe a poquito Jose. Hey, are these actual baby back ribs. Yeah, help yourself. Thanks. Yeah, I need to make a reservation for the red-eye to New York tonight. Hey, do you mind if I turn on the TV. I got some money on the Lakers. You bet sports. I'll bet anything. I had 200 bucks on my sister's pregnancy test. How exactly do you know Mia. Oh, we used to do the ballet thing together, but I didn't have the discipline. No kidding. I still dance, but just for tips. Huh. I'll call you back. [TV PLAYING. You know, I'm thinking she probably needs her space. Probably. Mind if I hang out and watch the game. Be my guest. If you got cash, I could give you a lap dance at halftime. That'd be swell

showTwo-And-Half-Menj©nEditor: Jk2writ. Well, this is gonna b. a sucky weekend. Try spending it with an 11 -year-ol. who does nothing but complain. You mean me. Boy, no wonder they got t. write your name in your underwear. What am I supposed to do. - Watch TV. - There's nothing on. - Play a video game. - I've played them all. - Read a book. - Yeah, right. Who's the moron now. Okay. Here's a rainy day activity. There are 12 college basketball games o. this weekend. Dial this number, and ask for Coop. Tell him you're calling for Mr. Bojingle. and write down everything he tells you. Do I get to mak. some picks this time. - You got money. - Lf you pay me what you owe me. Well, you're getting an education here. That's priceless. - What's going on. - Just talking about picking colleges. - I like Duke. - Over Wake Forest. Got a hunch. You've got him thinking about college. You're welcome. So how'd it go at the doctor. Sit down. I have to tell you something. What. The doctor wants m. to have a procedure. - What kind of procedure. - He says I'm fine... ...and it's routine. but I'm really freaked out about it. What procedure. A colonoscopy. Oh, jeez, Alan, that's no big deal. They're just gonna shov. a camera up your ass. Okay, in all future reference. to this procedure... ...can we please us. the word "glide" or "slide"... ...as opposed to "shove.. Don't sweat it. Every guy eventuall. has to get one of those. - It's strictly a fact-finding mission. - You've had one. No, you crazy. But I hear there's nothin. to worry about. It's a tiny little camera. In the old days, they'd sen. a sketch artist up there. Besides, you're unconscious. That's what I'm worried about. I'll be in a very vulnerable position. - They could do anything. - Alan, it's not a pirate ship. Just relax. It'll be over before you know it. Yeah. I'll bet that's what they sa. on pirate ships. - Damn it. - What. The sink's stopped up again. That kid doesn't know the differenc. between the garbage and the drain. - What do you want? He's 11. - That's no excuse. If he can't tell which hole is whic. at his age, he's headed for trouble. How about that. Oh, God, I had the worst nightmares. Pirate ships. Full-service gas stations. I fail to see the connection. Cold steel nozzle. going into openings. Dipsticks being pulled out. Do I have to draw you a picture. You know what. You need to get your mind of. this colonoscopy. Come on! Get in there, you sucker. Easy for you to say. How about this. How about we hop in the ca. and go to Vegas for a couple of days. Just like that? What about Jake. Oh, yeah, Jake. Okay, how about this, we get hi. a fake mustache and a hat... ...and tell everybody his mothe. was a heavy smoker. - I don't think so. - We can still bring him... ...come on, it's the perfect solution. The kid's bored... ...and you're all puckered u. over this colonoscopy thing. It just won't go in. - Well, it is a three-day weekend. - Exactly. And I got 2 grand in my pocket that'. itching to turn into $ 12 and a hangover. Come on, we can be ther. in like four hours. Unless you drive. in which case I'm not going. Perfect, now I can't get it out. You know what? Why not. One way or another... ...I'm gonna get reamed. I might as well enjoy a free buffet. Great. Go grab a toothbrus. and we'll hit the road. Pinky? Berta. Order a keg and call the gang. I got the house until Tuesday. Okay, we're gonna need two rooms. One for Alan Harper and son... ...and one for Charlie Harper an. a cocktail waitress to be named later. No, I don't want connecting rooms. Weren't you listening. In fact, put mine on a different floor. Come on, let's go. Now, what's playin. in your showroom. Nude Legends on Ice. Sweet. Okay, this ma. sound like a dumb question... ...but is it a family show. Well, what if the kid had a mustache. All right. He'll just have to stay i. the room and watch scrambled p0rn. - You could help me, you know. - No, you're doing okay. - Where's your clean underwear. - I'm wearing it. - That's all you brought for the weekend. - It's only three days. All right, we'll pick some up there. They'd last five day. if I turn them inside out. What's going on? Aren't you ready. - I'm packing Jake. - For what, college. - What the hell's this. - So he can go swimming. - Where. - They have pools in Vegas, Charlie. Why don't you bring a frying pan. they got kitchens too. - Let's see. Sport jacket. - He doesn't need a sport jacket. What if we take him someplace nice. Take him someplace nice. Alan, if I wanna throw away money. I'll play keno. - Can I gamble in Vegas. - No. - Why am I going. - Because all the kennels are full. Now, come on. Let's go. - Charlie, I haven't packed myself yet. - What've you been doing. I changed the phone message... ...to tell people we'd be out of town. I put together a first aid kit... ...I turned the fridge thermostat down. because it doesn't have to be cold... ...I called the pape. and stopped delivery... ...and I erased an old Mad Libs book... ...so we'd have somethin. to entertain us in the car. - Mad Libs, huh. - Yeah. Let me see that. Go get packed. Wait until you see Vegas, Jake. There's action everywhere you look. 24 hours a day, seven days a week. How does that help me. I can't gamble. and I have to be in bed at 9:30. Hey, when we go to Disneylan. do I complain that I hate... ...every aspect of the entire experience. - Yeah. Well, then you know how irritating it is. - Blackjack. - That's it. Yep. You owe me another dollar. - This stinks. - You wanna quit. Just deal the cards. Attaboy. Uncle Charlie, what's a colonoscopy. - Didn't your dad tell you. - He said it was just a test... ...and it was no big deal. so I looked it up. - And. - I don't believe it. Believe it. Wouldn't it be easier to go i. the other way. - You'd think, but no. - Why do they have to do it. - They just wanna see what's going on. - Did Dad lose something. Because when I swallowed 35 cents. we just waited for it to come out. - No kidding. - Yeah, but I only got 30 cents back. Well, the house always takes a cut. - What're you gonna do. - Hit me. Okay, okay. In Vegas, you don't say, "Hit me.. If you want a card, you go like this. Okay, fine. - Busted. You owe me another dollar. - What if I didn't want another card. You go like this. That's what I meant to do. There's no do-overs in Vegas. What's the signa. to go to the bathroom. There is no signal. you just get up and go. Unless you're on a hot streak. in which case you sit and wet yourself. - You're kidding, right. - You're wearing a $50 pair of slacks... ...and you got $600 on the table. do the math. I have to do math and pee my pants. Alan, are you ready yet. Just about. - And where'd I get the $600. - You've been saying that for 20 minutes. - What are you doing. - Financial planning. I don't wanna look, but I gotta. In class, if we have to go the bathroom. we do this or this. - Get it. - Yeah. I got it. Two hundred and eighty, 280, 280. - What the hell are you doing. - Hang on. Two... Oh, thanks. Now you made me lose count. Ten, 10, 10. Twenty, 20, 20. Stop it, stop it. Why are you doing this. - I have a system. - Do tell. I divide my gambling mone. into three equal piles. The first one is for day one. That I'll put in my money belt. You're wearing a money belt. Oh, good, you can't tell. I was afraid it made me look chunky. Anyway, the second pil. is for day two. I'll give that to you... ...under no circumstances do you giv. it back to me before midnight... ...which would b. the start of day two. Un-freaking-believable. What's the last pile for. That's the most important pile. That's the money I hid. in my Frye boot. - In your boot. - But I pretend that I don't have it... ...so that if disaster strike. and I've lost piles one and two... ...then I can pull it out. and poof, I'm solvent again. - Okay. I think I understand. - Pretty clever, huh. Yeah. That's a nice boot. - Let me see it. - Oh, sure. Get dressed and let's go. Okay. - Twenty-one. - Turn over your hole card. Oh, 27. Close, 29. Okay, I'm good. Alrighty. Viva Las Vegas. - Oh, Alan. - What. We're going in a Mercedes. not a time machine. Should I change. You should, but after all these years. I doubt you will. - What's this. - Oh, toiletries, sundries, whatnot. - Really. - Yeah, you'll thank me. Not all hotels supply shower cap. and sewing kits. Get in the car. Jake, come on. - Hold on a second. - Oh, for God's sake. Now what. Okay, let's go. - Well, you don't have a fever. - I told you, he's fine. Let's go. Charlie, he threw up i. your umbrella stand. Did you miss that. So? Vegas is full of peopl. who throw up. They built that city on a sea of vomit. - I'm okay, I can go. - That's the spirit. You wanna drive five hours with . puking kid in the back of your Mercedes. He can stick his head out the window. Let the guy behind us worry. - We're not going. - Oh, come on. . . . . - It's probably just something he ate. - All right. What have you eate. in the last 24 hours. Well, let's see. two bowls of Cocoa Puffs... ...a couple blueberry Pop-Tarts. bag of string cheese. That reminds me. we need more string cheese. Then, for lunch, a Hot Pocke. and a Bagel Bite. Then dinner, fried chicken, mashe. potatoes and a baloney sandwich. Okay, it's not what he ate. Then, for a snack, I had a glass of Tan. and some Cheetos. That explains the orange vomit. It's probably a stomach virus. Oh, please. I throw up all the time. It's just nature's way of saying. "Everybody out of the pool.. - I'm putting him to bed. Come on. - They have beds in Vegas. - What if he needs a doctor. - They have doctors in Vegas. I bet if we looked around, we could fin. a casino with a hospital theme. You know, Caesars Sina. or something. I'll get it. Hello? Hey, Mom. Fine. Nothing. I threw up in Uncle Charlie'. umbrella stand... ...and we're going to Vegas. - No. What kind of a father are you. I am a good father. When he threw up, I cancelled the trip. But you were planning to tak. my 11 -year-old to Las Vegas. It's really a family town now. The mob hardly ha. any influence at all anymore. Oh, good, Charlie. That helps. Were you planning o. telling me about this. What happens in Vega. stays in Vegas, Mom. Oh, good, Jake. That helps. - Honey, why don't you go lie down. - Why? I'm fine. Is it too late to get our bets dow. with Coop. - What bets. - Who's Coop. Go lie down. You're delirious. Listen, Judith, I don't thin. you understand what's going on here. - Oh, really. - Yeah. - You see, this trip was my idea. - I'm shocked. Let me finish. You see, I wanted to cheer Alan up... Charlie, don't. It's personal. She has a right to know. Judith, Alan got some bad new. from the doctor yesterday. Oh, my God, Alan. What is it. Well, the doctor say. I have to have a colonoscopy. - Are you having problems. - No, it's just routine. - So. - So I'm really nervous about it. That's it. Well, it's a long, snaky thin. with a camera. Oh, please. Your son wa. 10 pounds at birth... ...and his head wa. the same size it is now. That's kind of apples and oranges. isn't it. - Goodbye, Alan. - Wait, wait, wait, Judith. - Aren't you gonna take Jake with you. - No, I'm not taking him. He's fine. Don't think I don't see what's going. You put Jake up to telling me he's sick... ...so you could pawn him of. while you went to Las Vegas. He did throw up. Smell the umbrella stand. I'm not buying it. I'll get him Monday night. And if I find ou. you took him to Vegas... ...you'll get a colonoscop. from my attorney. I've seen your alimony checks. You already got one. So, what's the deal. Are we going. - I don't think so. - Why? I'm fine. - Yeah, but your mom said, "No.. - Oh, man. Don't eat anything orange. - You wanna know what I think. - Not at all. I think if she wanted t. keep you on a leash... ...she shouldn't have divorced you. - I'm not on a leash. I never was. You were living her. for three weeks... ...before you were getting u. on the couch without permission. Can we just drop it. It was a bad idea. There are no bad ideas. There's jus. a lack of will to execute them. We're men, Alan. Single men. We go where we want, when we wan. and how we want. Usually without so much toiletries... ...but I'm trying to be flexible here. - I explained about the toiletries. The point is, you can't let your ex-wif. control your behavior... ...no matter how stupi. or self-destructive it might be. - Charlie, l... - What profit a man... ...if he escapes the iron shackle. of matrimony... ...only to surrender to sexually frustrate. tyranny of a vengeful ex-wife. You know what? You're right. - We're men. - Right, are you with me. - I'm with you. - Grab your pack, we're going to Vegas. - Jake. - Just a sec. It's okay. It's mostly water. I'm fine. Let's go. We're men. Nope. You're too sick. Some other time. I'm really sorry I ruined the trip. Uncle Charlie. Hey, it's not your fault. It's your dad who won't let you go. - Thanks, Charlie. - Why should he feel guilty. Here. Put this on Wake Forest. Game's over, Jake. They lost. - What about the spread. - They didn't cover. Give me back my money. Get some rest. - I'm hungry. - Get used to it. - That's some great kid. - Yeah. Sick as a dog. and all he wants is a little action. Well, he gets that from you. You think so. - Because I do try to be a role model. - I know you do. Listen, there's no reaso. you have to stick around. He's gonna sleep. I can keep an eye on him. No, no, I couldn't go now. Why not? You wanted to go to Vegas. You should go. You're probably gonna have a better tim. without Jake and me. Probably? Unquestionably. - Then why don't you go. - I don't know. It just feels somehow wron. to abandon the kid when he's sick. Now you know what it feels lik. to be a parent. How inconvenient. - What's that. - It sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd. Berta. Surprise. I'm gonna start the IV. In a few seconds. you're gonna feel drowsy. No. No drowsy. I wanna be out. Completely out. Don't worry, you will be. - Right, doctor. - Aye. You won't be remembering anything. me bucko. Thanks, doc. Here's the 2 gran. for your children's hospital. And remember, when he wakes up. you're a gas station attendant

showTwo-And-Half-Menj±aEditor: Jk2writ. I don't know what he did, Charlie. The teacher calle. and told me to come get him. I want it on the recor. that if the kid was running... ...a blackjack game under bleacher. he didn't get it from me. What? I said, he didn't. Well, I can assure you he did not lear. that kind of crass behavior from me. Maybe I should wait in the hall. Hold on. What is he doing here. Well, my car is in the shop, and Charli. was nice enough to give me a ride. No, Charlie was nice enough to call yo. a cab, but you wouldn't take it. So, what's going on. Your son gave his teacher the bird. Okay, I want it on the recor. that he didn't necessarily... Charlie, just leave it alone. What exactly happened. I was writing on the boar. and he thought I couldn't see him. - Is this true. - Yeah, I really thought she couldn't see. I'm afraid this kind of behavio. is grounds for suspension. - Maybe we can catch a matinee. - Yeah. Jake, why did you fli. Miss Pasternak off. Excuse me. We don't end our sentence. with prepositions. We say. "Why did you flip off Miss Pasternak?. I think that answers your question. Jake, why did you flip of. Miss Pasternak. Because she picks on me. Jake, I don't treat you any differentl. than any of the other students. - Yeah, right. - Shut up. You know, I'd like to tal. to your parents alone. - Come on, Jake. - What, I don't even get to tell my side. Buddy, you're 11. You have no side. This isn't my fault. I was provoked. - You were provoked. - Yeah, it means... I know what it means. And it doesn't matter. What you need to do now is apologize. - But I'm not sorry. - You don't have to be sorry. Just say it and look it. You've got thos. big, cute kid eyes. Use them. - That would be lying. - That's your line in the sand. You muttonhead, you just flipped of. your teacher. - Yeah, but I was being honest. - And look where it got you. I think I just lost my innocence. He's really a very well-behaved boy... ...but he has had some problem. dealing with our separation. That's true. Although it wasn't so muc. a separation as a kicking out. I sympathize, but if I gav. special consideration to every child... ...whose parents are going throug. divorce, I'd be getting the finger all day. We're not sayin. he shouldn't be punished. - He certainly should. - But just let us try to handle it. By "us" he means me. I always have to be the bad guy. You're better at it than me. Than I. You are such an ass. - Can we have a moment, please. - I think that'd be a good idea. And it's. "May we have a moment, please?. Stop it. Miss Pasternak. I'm sorry, we haven't officially met. - I'm Jake's uncle, Charlie. - Hello. And I am really sorry. This may not be my place... ...and if it's not. I am really sorry... ...but Jake has somethin. he wants to say. I am really sorry. - And I'm really sorry too. - Why are you sorry. The kid may have gotte. the rude gesture from me. I'm not used to being around childre. and, well, I am really sorry. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. but it doesn't change what Jake did. You're right. You're absolutely right. Jake, go to the vending machine... ...and get Miss Pasterna. a peach Snapple and a bag of Skittles. It is Miss Pasternak, right. Now, this one's calle. "Read Between the Lines.. You're giving the finger. but you've got plausible deniability. Cool. Like the Itchy Eye. Exactly. Now, this one's calle. "the Slow Crank.. Charlie. As you can see, it's effectiv. but lacks deniability. - Dad, check it out. Balloon Finger. - Okay, that's enough. Do we need to be teaching hi. more ways to flip people off. Flip off people. Charlie, do you realize how clos. he came to being suspended today. - I do. - And do you understand... ...how lucky we are Miss Pasterna. decided to give him a chance. Lucky? Sure, why not. Let's call it luck. What does that mean. It means I'm too modes. to call it skill. - Hey, Dad. - What. How come only one finge. is the bad finger. I don't know, Jake. This one's okay, right. Right. - Dad. - What. Anything. No. I don't get it. Who decides. Uncle Charlie, I had a weird dream. And it's getting weirder. Hey, buddy. Why aren't you asleep. I'm hoping I am. - Hello, Jake. - Hello, Miss Pasternak. Listen, buddy, Miss Pasternak and . are kind of having a sleepover. Because we're like, you know, friends. No way. Jake, I'm only your teache. from 8: 15 to 3:00. After that I'm just a perso. like anybody else. This is more wrong than the tim. I saw Santa peeing at the mall. Okay, why don't we wrap up thi. after-school special and call it a night. Don't worry. This won't chang. anything between us at school. So you're still gonna be mean to me. That's right. Same old junkyard dog. - Come on, buddy. Get some sleep. - Oh, yeah. Like I'm gonna sleep now. - Do you think he'll be okay. - Sure. He's just not used to seeing his teache. out of the classroom. And her pants. I'll talk to him in the mornin. and make sure he's okay... ...and that he keeps this to himself. - Thank you, Charlie. Oh, Miss Pasternak. Why do you never call m. by my first name. I don't know. This just seems way hotter. - Charlie. - Yes, Miss Pasternak. Do you think Jake believe. we're just friends. Why not? We are, right. I mean, once I get to know you bette. I'm pretty sure I'd consider you a friend. Charlie, we both kno. there's much more than friendship... ...going on between you and me. - Much more. How much more. Well, I know this is pretty quic. and I don't wanna use the L word... - Good. Thank you. ...but this feels an awful lot like love. I'm sorry, which L wor. didn't you want to use. Oh, Charlie. Come on. - Let's go to sleep. - Yeah. Like I'm gonna sleep now. - Morning. What are you doing. - Morning. Making my world-famous huevo. rancheros for my brother and nephew. No kidding. What stupid thing did you d. you're trying to make up for. Why do you always just assume that.... I slept with Jake's teacher. Oh, Charlie, did you learn nothin. from the den-mother fiasco. It gets worse. The kid found out. - What about your brother. - He doesn't know yet. Oh, hey, you made breakfast. What's the occasion. No occasion. Just trying to help out. Well, thank you. I really appreciate it. Good morning, Berta. Morning, you goofy, clueless b*st*rd. Nice to see her in a pleasant moo. for a change. Yeah. Sit down. Have some huevos. - Fresh-squeezed orange juice. - You squeezed this. No, it says it on the can. Okay, what stupid thing did you do. Well, funny thing... I slept with Miss Pasternak. Charlie, what were you thinking. What if Jake finds out. Okay... Oh, no! Oh, no! How. - He woke up in the middle of the night... - You brought her here. Did you learn nothin. from the den-mother fiasco. - Hey, I kept him from getting suspended. - Oh, that's how. - You're welcome. - Are you crazy. No, but I have a sneaking suspicio. Miss Pasternak may be. - What's that supposed to mean. - Don't worry, I'll deal with it. Oh, that makes me feel much better. So how did Jake take it. Did he freak out. Not as much as you. - Morning. - See? He's fine. Jake, do you wanna talk abou. what you saw last night... ...with Uncle Charli. and Miss Pasternak. Oh, God. That really happened. Good, Alan. Way to go. Dad, can I be homeschooled. Listen, Jake. Don't worry. You go to school. don't say anything to anybody. I'll tell her I can't see her anymor. and we'll forget this happened. Man, it's like Cub Scout. all over again. - I hope you saved room for dessert. - I saved room for you. You sure. Because I'm just empty calories. How about a nice fruit cup. Two fruit cups, please. Listen, Delores. We need to talk. Oh, call me Miss Pasternak. No, let's keep this friendly. Dolores, you're a terrific woman an. I've enjoyed being with you very much... ...but I know deep in my hear. that you can do so much better than me. - Okay. I understand. - Good. Thank you. You're insecure. But don't worry. I am not going to abandon you. . . . . No, no, no, that's no. what I'm worried about. See, Delores... I'm a bad man. I'm a player. I go from woman to woman and then... Charlie, that's the past. I'm not going to give up on us. and you wanna know why. Why. Because somebody told m. that we belong together. Really. It can't be somebody who knows me. Oh, he knows you very well. And he loves you even more than I do. Our union has been ordained, Charlie. What? Come again. After we fornicated... ...I prayed for forgivenes. and I was told not to worry about it. By the same guy. There's only one guy, Charlie. And his loving hand has been guiding m. ever since I quit pole dancing in Reno. No kidding. Which club. - Did you dress like a schoolteacher. - It doesn't matter. What matters is the same han. that delivered me... ...from my life of degradatio. has brought me to you. For what? More degradation. No. To help you become a better man. To achieve your potential. Now sit up straigh. and eat your fruit. - All right. - All right, what. All right, Miss Pasternak. Hey, Charlie. Guess who. I know we didn 't make plans for tonigh. but we really should get together... ... and talk more about this pat. we are on and where it's heading. We know where it's headin. but it would mean a lot to me... ... to hear the words come ou. of your mouth. Your beautiful, blessed mouth. Call me, sweetheart. Boy, it's weird being on the other sid. of one of these calls. I can imagine. Well. - Professional opinion. - Please. Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. Yeah, I thought so. I mean, she barely knows you. Where does she get of. being so forward. Rose, we had one night together and yo. handcuffed yourself to my refrigerator. That was different. We were meant to be together. Okay, I was gonna ask yo. the best way to end this... ...but I realize now that breakup. may be outside your area of expertise. Yeah. I do mate for life. I'm like a penguin that way. Plus, I like to slide across the ic. on my belly. Uncle Charlie, guess what happene. with Miss Pasternak today. - I'm just about to break up with her. - Oh, no, don't, don't. - Why not. - Look at this. Hey, you got an A in history. - Way to go, Jake. - Look at his answers. "Abraham Lincoln signe. the Emancipation Proclamation in pen.. For this he got an A. Everybody got an A. She was, like, happy all day. She even gave me bac. my fake dog poop. Charlie, I gave you this poop. You broke into my hous. and left it on my pillow. Still, you regifted. And I thought you were a classy guy. Jake, why don't you go to your roo. and do your homework. She didn't give us any. First time ever. I love you, Uncle Charlie. - Oh, man. - Yeah. Yeah, I think you kno. what you have to do. - Break up with Miss Pasternak, right. - Hell, no. He's getting A's. He hasn't gotten an . since naptime in kindergarten. - But he's not learning anything. - Charlie, get your priorities straight. I'm trying to get hi. into a decent middle school. After he's accepted he can lear. that Sacajawea... ...wasn't "a bag full of jawea.. - Ready for dinner. - Charlie. It's so good to see you. It's okay to see you too. - Charlie. - What. - Gum. - Oh, sorry. What a great day I had. All the kids were so well-behaved. Even Jake. - That's nice. - Can I tell you a little secret. I never really cared for Jake. But you said you treated hi. like all the other kids. Well, you have to say that. So where are we going to dinner. I hadn't really decided. You came unprepared. Charlie, you have so much potentia. if only you'd apply yourself. All right, I gotta tell you. My weirdness bar for chick. is pretty high... ...but you are clearing i. in street shoes. You're mad at me. - No, no. - Yes, you are. - No, no. Not... Not mad. - Then what's your problem. Nothing. Forget it. Let's just have a nice evening. Oh, Charlie, that is so sweet. Let's never fight again. Oh, no. I hate it. Hey, can I use the restroom. May I use the restroom. Oh, right. - May I. - You're excused. Thank you. Charlie. Look, I'm really sorr. it didn't work out with Miss Pasternak. You gotta know. I went the extra mile to make her happy. Alan, you know what that means. and Jake, you'll understand someday. Oh, come on, guys. I said I'm sorry. Okay, she's being really unfai. with all this homework. You know what I'll do. I'm gonna complain to the principal. Maybe you should date the principal. Very funny. Is that an option. Because I would if it would get m. out of writing 2500 words... ...on The Red Badge of Courage. Man, book reports suck. - Dad. - Yeah. Please keep him awa. from my karate teacher

showTwo-And-Half-Menj·cEditor: Jk2writ. Hey, Jake, why don't you tell Grandm. about your spring break. - Bad idea. - What. Nothing. I just saw that they're movin. the L.A. Gardening Exposition... ...to the Convention Center. which I think is a very bad idea. Thanks for the update. Go ahead, Jake, tell Grandma. - It was really cool, l... - Hang on a second, Jake. I'm not sure you understan. how serious this gardening thing is. It's a really bad idea. I get it. Bad idea. Go ahead, Jake. I went campin. with Grandma and Grandpa. We slept in a tent. we cooked on an open fire. And we went hiking and saw a bear. You let him spend an entire vacatio. with his other grandparents... ...and I haven't had him for a night. Oh, bad idea. This is unfair and unacceptable. From the momen. that boy was born... ...Judith's parents squeezed me out. And you let them. Interesting point. Excuse me, Mom. but when Jake was born... ...Judith's mother stayed with us. cooking and cleaning... ...and taking care of him. - Valid counterpoint. Exactly. She's a pushy, pushy woman. Personal opinion. No, no. You went on a cruise. But Judith was two days late. And I had nonrefundable reservations. Like it would have killed he. to get a C-section. Self-obsessed psychotic rant. - Mom, are you listening to yourself. - Stupid question. Awkward silence. You wanna spend more tim. with your grandson, he's right here. No. He goes to visi. his other grandparents. He should come to visit me. - So you wanna spend a week with him. - A week. Alan, I do have a life. I'm confused. What exactly do you want. The same quality time Jake spend. with his other grandparents. But, you know, less. I'll tell you what. Bring hi. to my place around 6-ish tonight. I'll make him dinner. we'll have a fun sleepover. - Gee, Mom, I don't know. - Well, why not. Are you afraid one night with m. will irreparably damage him. - Yeah. - A little. Excuse me. I didn't hear any complaint. when I was raising you two. The teenage drinking and constan. running away wasn't a slight tip-off. Oh, you were jus. a little drama queen, Charlie. And let's not forget. you always came back. Kind of hard to find steady wor. when you're 9. Whatever. My place, 6-ish. Judith! I can't just leave him with yo. without discussing it with his mother. Are you telling me you need to ge. your ex-wife's approval... ...to let your own son spend tim. with your own mother. He had a really bad lawyer. You know what your problem is, Alan. You let women walk all over you. You get that from your father. Well, nevertheless. I still have to clear it with Judith. - Well, fine, call her. - Right now. Well, why not. Unless you'd rather I make the call. Probably not home. I'll just... I'll leave a message. Yeah. Hi, Judith. Listen, it's Alan. Call me back when you get a chance. Hello? Oh, hi, Judith. you old call-screener, you. Listen, I just wante. to run something past you. Jake was telling my mom abou. the fun time he had with your parents... ...and she thought that... What do you mean, "no". I haven't even asked yet. Oh, really. Well, I've got news for you, lady. You can't say no. she's his grandmother. Well, she may be that too... ...but she's still his grandmothe. and this is my weekend with him. Charlie and I turned out fine. We did too. Look, he's going, and that's that. All right then, goodbye. - It's settled. He'll be there at 6. - Thank you. Of course, it is rather short notice. - Mom. - Okay. Fine. But don't get used to this. I'm not your full-time babysitter. I played that wrong, didn't I. No, no. You called mom's bluf. and you stood up to your ex-wife. You maintained your self-respect. I'm proud of you. - Yeah, but what about Jake. - Oh, Jake. Jake's screwed. This has been the greatest day o. my life. Movies, laser tag, video arcade. Well, that's good. I wanted today to be special. - How come. - Just because I love you. I love you too, Dad. You know how people sa. you can't buy love. I think they're wrong. You hold on to that sentiment. What's the plan for tonight. Is it gonna be special too. Oh, God, I can't watch this. - What. - Nothing. Oh, hey, here's $20. Wow, thanks. - You're spending tonight at Grandma's. - Great. Wait, what. You're gonna have lots of fun. - Right, Charlie. - This is the first I'm hearing of it. I don't want to go to Grandma's. Here, take your money. Come on, buddy. She loves you very much. And it's just for one night. But we were having so much fun. Think it through, Jake. Why were you having so much fun. - You tricked me. - Attaboy. What did I ever do to you. It's not a punishment. It's not a prize. - I'm calling Mom. - No. No, no calling Mom. I know my rights. I get one phone call. - I've already told your mother. - She agreed. She knows about it. Uncle Charlie. can you get me out of this. It depends. Are you willing to liv. in Mexico for a few years. Jake, please. Do it as a favo. to your grandmother, who loves you. For me. For Uncle Charlie. But most of all, for me. What do I get. What do you mean. I spent a fortune on you today. That was because you love me. Now you need me. Oh, God, this is a great kid. Okay. What do you want. A motorized Razor scooter. the new Dragon Ball Z game... ...an iPod min. and not to go to Grandma's. - I'll give you three out of four. - Okay. Forget the iPod. - This is the worst day of my life. - Come on. You're gonna eat your dinner. watch some videos, play some games... ...and you're gonna go to bed an. we'll pick you up tomorrow. Promise. Your word means nothing to me. Hey, give your dad a break. So he lied. You don't get the virgin to the volcan. by telling her you're gonna push her in. - Can't we just go home. - No. Now, enough of this. - I am the adult and you are the child. - And this is the volcano. Now, you're gonna go in ther. and you're gonna have a nice evening. - Do we understand each other. - Yes. Thank you. Now, ring the bell. So exactly what time are you...? Hey. We've done a terrible thing. Yeah. If only there was a magical liqui. that could erase bad memories. I am absolutely racked with guilt. Alan, don't beat yourself up. You're a good dad who, in a momen. of weakness, betrayed his only son. Come on, he's not in any real danger. Not physically. but you know as well I do... ...that Mom has the abilit. to say things that stick with you. Yeah, forever and ever. My favorite was, " They must hav. mixed you up with another baby... ...because I could never have given birt. to such a hateful child.. Who writes that o. a fifth-grader's birthday card. How about, " It's no wonde. your father stays at work. If I could get out of here. I would too.. Did I ever tell you about the tim. I wrote my first jingle. Pepsi. I invited Mom over to watc. the prime-time network debut. For 30 seconds, 20 million peopl. were listening to my music. And at the end. Mom turned to me and said. "You couldn't get Coke to hire you?. - Nice. But I can top it. - Go. It's the day of my wedding. She's sitting there crying. And I think it's because she's happy. Turns out it was because she was. and I quote. "So relieved you finally foun. someone who could love you.. - We gotta go get Jake. - You're right. Come on. Great game, ladies. - He'll be fine. - Who. - Jake. - Oh, yeah. He'll be fine. - Who. - Jake. He'll be fine. I thought we'd eat Japanese-style. Good Lord, are you picking your nose. I had to. There was stuff in it. And where were you plannin. to put it. I really didn't have a plan. Don't you dare wipe tha. on my furniture. And not on your clothes either. - What are you doing now. - Putting it back. Here, just wipe your hands. - Why. - Because we're going to eat dinner. And you've been rooting aroun. in your nostril. It's okay. I don't eat with my hands. I use a fork. - Wipe your hands. - Okay. Thank you. Has your mother or fathe. ever taken you out for sushi. No. I don't like raw fish. - Well, have you ever had it. - No. How do you know you don't like it. It's an educated guess. Well, why don't you just try it. Let's start with the tuna, shall we. There you go. That's not tuna. Oh, yes, it is. I've had tuna. Jake, it's tuna. Now, why don't you just tak. a little bite. Here. Dip it in the soy sauce first. . . . . There you go. Have a bite. You know, there's a girl at school. Elizabeth Kurzner... ...and her mom ate a bunch of sushi. and it had worms. And they grew in he. and crawled out of her eyes. - Oh, no, they didn't. - How do you know. - Just take a little bite. - Okay. - Jake. - It's gross. It tastes like worms. Jake, stop spitting on my rug. - Where do you want me to spit. - Don't spit at all. - I gotta get the taste out. - Have some ginger. - No, Jake, that's wasabi. - What. Are you trying to kill me. No, Jake, don't. That's an expensive pillow. Let... Give me that. Okay, here. I've just gotta ask. Playing volleyball on the beach every day. don't you worry about melanoma. Alan, walk with me. Be right back. - What. - Listen closely. No man has ever gotten into a woman'. pants chitchatting about skin cancer. You can't possibly know that. Nevertheless. Let's steer the conversation awa. from tumors, okay. - Okay. So which one do you like. - One. God, in his infinite wisdom, has given u. a big box of assorted chocolates... ...and you're just gonna try one. So are you thinking, like, two. I was thinking, like, nine. - But we'll see what happens. - You're not serious. His will be done. What else do we have to eat. You mean other than the $50 wort. of sushi in my carpet. Yeah. - I don't suppose you'd eat squab. - No. - Do you even know what it is. - No. But it sounds pretty creepy. "Squab.. Well, what would you eat. Pretty much anything. except sushi and squab. Squab, squab. Squab, squab, squab. squab, squab, squab... - Stop it. - Sorry. Squab. Would you eat spaghetti. - I love spaghetti. - Great. Would you prefer vermicelli or linguine. Spaghetti. All right. What would you like on it. Puttanesca, Bolognese, Milanese. olive oil with truffles. How about squab. I'm just kidding. Ketchup. - Of course. - And sliced-up hot dogs. Unbelievable. My grandson is a hillbilly. You know, I'm thinking we shoul. move this party over to my place. But we've been playin. volleyball all day. We're all sweaty and sticky. No problem. Mi shower es su shower. - What. - I have a shower. - Good. You live alone. - Pretty much. My brother stays with me and he's go. a kid, but he's at his grandmother's. Oh, that is so sweet. Yeah, well, we're sweet people. I was raised by my grandma. I called her Nana. - Is that so. - Yeah. I was raised by my grandma. I called her Nana. Oh, yeah. She was a big influence on me. She raised me. I called her Nana. Oh, Jake, what have we done to you. Dinner, such as it is, is served. Jake? Where are you. Come into the dining room. Squab. Alan. Alan, I'm worried about the kid. What kid. Your kid. Our kid. I think we shoul. go to Mom's and get him. Oh, come on, he's fine. And it's just for one night. Which, by the way, is rapidly becomin. one of the best nights of my life. And grind, and grind. And step and step and turn. Alan. Alan, please. Hey, if you're worried. why don't you call. And grind, and grind. And grind and grind and grind. - What's her number. - You don't have her on speed dial. Hey, if I can't eat it, bang i. or bet on it, it's not in my phone. It's ringing. And grind, and grind. And I'm a lucky boy. Hello? Mom. I can't talk to you now, Charlie. Get that out of your mouth. Are you an animal. Mom? Hello? Hello. And grind, and grind. And step and step and... You don't understand, Charlie. It was a women's volleyball tea. and I could've been the volleyball. - Get your priorities straight, will you. - I've got my priorities straight. I've had a kid for 11 years. but I've never had group s*x. Alan, you didn't miss anything. It's an overrated male fantasy. - Really. - No, are you kidding. He'd better be scarred for life. - Mom. - Oh, hello, boys. What happened? Where's Jake. I sent him up to take a bath. He had hot dog. and spaghetti in his hair. Why would he have hot dog. and spaghetti in his hair. Because he wouldn't eat squab. Squab. - What are you guys doing here. - We wanted to see how things were. - They're okay. - See, he's fine. - Let's go back to the bar. - And take me with you. - Jake. - Yeah. Did you turn the water of. in the bathtub. - Say goodbye to Grandma. - Goodbye, Grandma. Night, Mom. You realize that in one night. he did what we couldn't do in a lifetime. He broke her. He chewed her up and spit her out. It was a beautiful thing. I'm gonna be truthful here, Alan. I always thought your ki. was a little bit of a simpleton. Me too. But clearly, he is the chosen one. Hey, guys, check it out. Pull my finger. Okay. And they shall call him Jake

showTwo-And-Half-MenjÕwEditor: Jk2writ. - Hey, buddy. - Hi, Uncle Charlie. - Ready for a fun weekend. - He's not gonna have a fun weekend. Charlie, he's gonna stud. for a history test on Monday. Well, if believing that gets you bac. in your car, I'll play along. - Where's Alan. - He's not here. Really? I told him I was on my way. That might be why he's not here. Okay, I'll just have to g. over everything with you. I'm gonna visit my parents. I won't pick Jake up till Wednesday. Alan has to take him to school. Monday is soccer practice. He has his math tuto. and his guitar teacher on Tuesday... Hang on. Hang on. Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NE. Oh, hi, Judith. Alan, why are you avoiding me. - I'm not avoiding you as much as... - Hiding. - Thank you. - Why were you hiding. Why does the wounded gazell. hide from the stealthy jaguar. Why does the helpless pigle. hide from ravenous wolverine. Animal Planet. You learn a lot. We need to tal. about your pain-in-the-ass mother. You know, I would love to... ...but as Charlie told you, I'm not here. - I let her take Jake out to dinner. She brought him home and she lecture. me for 15 minutes about his dirty ears. - Fifteen minutes, huh. - How long is this gonna take. Like I'm a bad parent. Let her try and get a Q-Ti. in a squirming 11 -year-old boy's ear. Mom didn't believe in Q-Tips. She had a squirt gun. You know, the woolly meerka. of western Africa... ...buries her cubs up to their neck. and licks their ears clean. What? It seemed apropos. If she wants to spend tim. with her grandson... ...she needs to back off. - Okay, I'll tell her. - Thank you. - I'll tell Alan you stopped by. Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what. - I don't remember. - You just read that chapter. Yeah, but Lewis and Clar. was a long time ago. Thanks for the ride, Sally. And for getting me home too. - Why is that funny. - It's not. Mustang Sally, giddyup. Now, Lewis and Clark. Face it, Dad. I'm just not good at history. Really? What did you hav. for lunch yesterday. A pizza square. Actually, tw. pizza squares, a ice cream sandwich... ...and a bag of Skittles. - Okay, see, that's history. And a Ding Dong and a diet root beer. - Great. - Wait. It wasn't a Ding Dong. - It was a Ho Ho. - Got it. You know what I like. Those big, pink things with coconut. - Snow Balls. - Exactly. Can you still get those. Yeah, but not at the supermarket. You have to go to 7-Eleven. Thank you. Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven. No, we are trying to study. All right, I'll hoof it. - Can I bring you back something. - Ding Dong. Who's there. I'm trying to get him ready for his test. Sorry. Sorry. You go ahead. I'll pretend I'm not here. Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what. Louisiana Purchase. - Right. - I knew that. Yeah, but Uncle Charlie buzzed first. And I'm still buzzed. - Okay, give me another question. - All right. Seward's Foll. is another name for. - Jake. - Alaska. - Very good. - Oh, I was gonna say Mrs. Seward. Okay, the score is 1 to 1. Now that you mention it... ...an Eskimo Pie would go dow. pretty good right now. Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven. No, next question. - The War of 1812... - 1812. - No. - 1813. Let me finish the question. The War of 1812 was fough. against whom. - The British. - Very good, 2 to 1, Jake. - Yes. - No fair. My buzzer's broken. - Next question. - Let me try yours. See? His works. All right, contestants. we are at the final round. The questions are worth more. - And the answers are harder. - True. - Wait for a question. - Okay. Here we go. Name three change. in American life... ...brought abou. by the industrial revolution. Populations shift to cities, employmen. moving from farms to factories, and... - Yes. - Sorry, I hit it by mistake. - Settlement of the West. - That's correct. - You are our new champion. - Yes. Settlement of the West. - You see, Jake? You know this stuff. - Yeah, I guess I do. - Trust me, you are gonna do great. - Yeah, thanks, Dad. You're welcome. Now go get ready for bed. - I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in. - Okey-dokey. Oh, I gotta get a security camera. Where's your brother. I wanna talk to him. - He's not here. - Oh, really. No, he's actually not here. You know what his ex-wif. said to me. Mom, please go away. She never calls me "Mom,. but that was the gist of it. I took Jake out to dinner... - You're pretending not to understand me. - Right. And all I did was suggest to Judith... ...that she might wanna pay a little mor. attention to her son's ear hygiene. Not only was she completel. unappreciative... ...but she had the nerve to denigrat. how I raised my sons. Yeah, because we turned out so well. Excuse me, but whateve. emotional issues you think you have... ...I kept your ears spotless. I remember. You used the same Super Soaker... ...to keep us off the furniture. Ladies and gentlemen... ...presenting noted schola. and A-student, Jake Harper. - You got an A. - I got an A. - All right. Way to go. - Congratulations, Jake. - Thanks. It's my first A this year. - Really? Well, it's none too soon then. - Mom, leave it alone. - I'm not saying anything. I think it's wonderful. Did anybody else in your class get an A. Almost everybody. Why. Oh, I was just curiou. as to how hard the test was. It doesn't matter, Mom. Still an A. An A is very nice. I just don't kno. why you're making such a big fuss... ...if they're just handing them ou. like rubella vaccinations. I don't know. It looks like a pretty hard test to me. - No, it was easy. - That's because you studied. - You earned that A. - Wendy Chow got an A-plus. You hear that. Wendy Chow got an A-plus. Wendy Chow is a freak of nature. She cloned a goldfis. for the science fair. We can't compare Jake to her. Who should we compare him to then. The paste eaters and the unibrows. Darling, if you set the ba. low in childhood... ...he may never reac. the heights he's capable of. You're condemning hi. to a life of failure and mediocrity. Is that what you want, Jake. A life of failure and mediocrity. No. You see? He may well be sharpe. than you give him credit for. I'm gonna go to my room. I am putting that A-pape. up on the fridge. Wow. Texas used to b. a separate country. Why did we change that. Not now, Charlie. How dare you. - Excuse me. - He worked hard on that test. He was finally feeling goo. about himself and his abilities... ...and in 30 second. you managed to suck... ...every bit of self-esteem out of him. You're like a... - A self-esteem sucker. - Yes, exactly. Alan, I was just havin. a conversation with the boy. No. No, you don'. have conversations. You... Suck self-esteem. I would've gotten it. Mom, I am sorry, but I don't thin. I want you around my son anymore. - What. - You heard me. You will not do to him... ...what you did to me and Charlie. - What did I do to you. What did you do? What did she.... Charlie, tell her. Why tell her when we can show her. I see. So you're bot. turning against me. Oh, I turned a long time ago. Alan's just catching up. All right, fine. If I'm not welcome here... ...I'll leave. My own sons are throwing me out. Goodbye. This isn't over, is it. No, we're screwed. Let me guess. Mom. She's been calling all morning. I'm starting to feel guilty. You can't show weakness, Alan. She'll sense it. Like the hooded cobra sense. the rapid heartbeat... ...of a panic-stricken kangaroo rat. But don't you fee. even a bit sorry for her. Does the mongoose feel sorr. for the wounded garden-snake. Does the dingo feel sorr. for the slow-crawling Australian baby. - You guys okay. - Oh, yeah, yeah. We're fine. Why. Your mother just called me. She sai. she's been trying to reach you... ...all mornin. and she's very worried. - We're fine, Rose. - We're not talking to her. Why? Because she tried to encourag. Jake to live up to his potential. That's a reason to throw her ou. and slam the door in her face. How could you be so crue. to your own mother. And the dingo has foun. another Australian baby. Rose, that's not what happened. We were protecting Jake. How? By ripping his only grandmothe. out of his life. - He has another grandmother. - Oh, right, the Sacramento pill-freak. Is that what she told you. For the record. Jake's other grandmother... ...is out of rehab and doing just fine. We appreciate your concern, Rose. Thanks for stopping by. So now you're just gonn. slam the door in my face. Pretty much. Not as satisfying with a glass door. Okay, first she start. with the phone calls... ...then she sent Rose over. I wonder what's next. I don't know, but I'm bettin. it'll be something big. Right. I understand, it's terrible. Okay, let me se. what I can do about it. How in the hell did your mothe. get my cell phone number. Sometimes. when the nest is threatened... ... the seemingly docile creatures hav. been known to eat their own young. Hey, did Mom call yo. at the office today. No, she call here. - No, it's been pretty quiet. - Yeah, maybe too quiet. And here we se. the female praying-mantis... ... after copulation. devouring her mate. Your ex-wife back from her parents'. Yeah, I dropped Jake of. with her this afternoon. Apparently her mom ha. a little relapse with the pills. - Oh, yeah. - They found her in pajamas... ...driving an imaginary car through th. home and garden section of Wal-Mart. How could they tel. if she was driving an imaginary car. She rolled down the windo. to ask for directions to the pharmacy. - Here we witness the... - Not Mom. Hello? Yeah, this is Charlie Harper. What? I see. Okay, then. Thanks for letting me know. - Who was that. - St. John's Hospital. Our mother checked in this evening wit. chest pains and breathing difficulties. - Oh, my God. - Ever wonder who was the first guy... ...to put pineapple on pizza. I bet he was gay. - Charlie... - No straight guy is gonna say. "You know what this pizza could use. A pineapple ring.. God bless him. It's good. Charlie, is Mom okay. Of course she's okay. She's faking. . . . . - How can you be so sure. - It really doesn't make any difference. If she is faking an. we rush to see her, she wins. If she's not faking. and we ignore her... ...she complain. about what horrible sons we are... ...and she still wins. What if she's not faking and she dies. Well, look at you, Mr. Glass Half-Full. I can't help thinking this is all my fault. I told Mom she couldn't se. her grandson and she had a heart attack. Alan, you forge. who you're dealing with. This woman buried two husband. and divorced two others. She's lived through wars. riots, earthquakes. Only way you're gonna bring her dow. is with a stake dipped in holy water. Here we are. Oh, my God. Mommy. Excuse me. - Are you family. - Yeah, we're her sons. Is she gonna be okay. Tell me she's gonna be okay. Your mother's gonna be fine. I can't find a thing wrong with her. - Are you sure. - As sure as I can be. Her heart's fine. Lungs are fine. Blood chemistry's good. EEG's normal. - Oh, thank God. - That bitch. Yeah, tell me about it. Excuse me. I'm gonna tell her she can go home. - Oh, no, please, let us. - Yeah, we owe her that. Suit yourself. Oh, better hurry, though. The nurses are circulatin. a"do not revive" petition. - You said there was nothing wrong. - It's a big hospital. Things happen. What do we do now. Don't worry. I got a plan. Oh, great, he has a plan. Mom. Charlie? Is that you. Alan's here too, Mom. - Hi, Mom. - Boys, you didn't have to come. Are you kidding? Of course we did. - Right, Alan. - Of course. Tell us what happened. I came home this afternoon, alone. I was walking up the stairs... ...alone. And I had trouble breathing... ...so I drove myself to the hospital... ...alone. - Well, why did you drive yourself. - Oh, I didn't wanna bother... ...the ambulance people. Why didn't you call us. Oh, you both made it very clea. how you feel about me. Now, that's not fair. Just tell Jake... ...his Grandmommy loves hi. very much. Don't talk like that. You can tell him yourself. after the operation. What operation. Relax. Relax. Quadruple bypasse. are routine these days. - Quadruple. - Yeah, yeah. You got four clogged arteries. Right, Alan. Right, the doctor said it's luck. you came when you did. Another few days and you'd have bee. flopping around on the floor like a carp. It's no big deal, Mom. They crack open you open... ...flush out the pipes, sew you back u. and you're good as new. Except, you know, for the big. gnarly scar on your chest. They're prepping the OR. We got the best surgeon available. He's young but really sharp. And well-respected in his own country. Well, all right. If it has to be done, it has to be done. I love you, boys. If the worst should happen... ...please remember that. - Yeah. Sure. - Of course. Oh, my God, Evely. Are you all right. Oh, Judith, is that you. Yes, I'm right here. Jake's here too. Oh, Jake. Come to Grandmommy, darling. I'm sorry you feel bad, Grandma. Oh, Grandmommy's feeling much bette. now that her little man is here. - I made you a get-well card. - Oh, isn't that nice. Gift shop wasn't open. You said you had a plan. Well, guess what? It was a bad plan. - Alan, calm down. - The plan sucked. - Don't worry. - Don't worry. She's expecting a quadruple bypass. What are we gonna do. We're gonna get her one. Must be someone around her. who can handle a rib spreader. - Charlie, that's insane. - You're right. There's no time. Better scrub up. She had to drive herself to the hospital. What is wrong with you two. - Relax, Judith. She's not sick. - What. She's faking and we called her bluff. and then she called ours. So now, we're gonn. have to cut her open. You want in. Hey, guess what. After Grandma's operation... ...she's gonna take m. to Magic Mountain, okay. Yeah, yeah, that's okay. We're gonna have to tell her. You sure. We don't need to do the bypass. All we do is put her out. slice her open. - The scar will sell it. - The truth, Charlie. Doesn't have to be a big scar. Okay, doctor, let's schedul. this as quickly as possible. Oh, great. I'll be here. Hello, boys. - What are you doing. - Lf I'm going to have to have surgery... ...I want my own doctor. Mom, you don't really need a surgeon. Oh, but I do. Your quadruple bypass stor. makes the perfect cover... ...for a little nip tuck. No turkey neck for Grandmommy, right. About Jake. I told hi. I'd take him to Magic Mountain... ...but you kno. how I feel about direct sunlight. Yeah, and wolfbane. You'll take him for me. won't you, Charlie. - Sure, Mom. - I'll make it up to him... ...by taking him out for a haircu. and some decent clothes. - He'll like that. - Sure, Mom. Maybe when his mother see. how nice he could look... ...she'll take the hint and stop dressin. him like a tackling dummy. Oh, the food here is just dreadful. So why don't you boy. run across the street... ...and get me a nice ahi tuna... Charlie, what in God's nam. are you doing. Just practicing. The worker bees, or drones... ... live a life of utter devotio. to their queen. You had a plan. From birth, these industriou. yet mindless creatures... ... slave away to fulfil. the queen 's every need. "Don't worry, Alan. I have a plan.. Until finally they reach the en. of their brief lifespan and die... ... becoming food and building material. for the rest of the hive. Alan, where's my sandwich. Coming, Mom. A cruel existence? Perhaps. But that's life on the Animal Planet

episodeEpisode-18-It Was 'Mame,' Momjª|Editor: Jk2writ. Some side effects include headaches. blurred vision, and high blood pressure. Ask your doctor if it's right for you. - Dad. - Yeah. Do you suffe. from erectile dysfunction. Well, Alan? Do you. Jake, wh... What do you kno. about erectile dysfunction. It's something to d. with your pen1s, right. - Right. - And they say one out of three guys... ...gets it, and mine's fine. so it's gotta be one of you. - I'm fine. - Not me, l... So, what are the pills for. Well, what they do, Jake, is tha. they... They dilate the blood vessels... ...which allows more bloo. to easily flow to certain... They're boner pills, Jake. To get them. or to make them go away. To get them. Go get ready for bed. What's the point. They're not good for anything. You ever try any of those drugs. Once or twice. Out of curiosity, not necessity. - What did you think. - Not my thing. It's like corking the bat. You. Yeah, that's what my ex-wife wanted. More s*x with me that lasted longer. Hello. Oh, hey, Eric. Hiya. What's happening, boyfriend. Oh, you're terrible. Do you kis. your mother with that mouth. So, what's up? Saturday. Let me check my book. Saturday is marvelous. How dressy? Eveningwear. or California casual. Oh, goody. An excuse to shop. Like I need one. Okey-dokey, artichokey. Ciao for now. - What. - Something you wanna tell me. That? Oh, that's Eric. He's the head of a big ad agency. - Throws a lot of jingle work my way. - He wouldn't be gay, would he. What difference does it make. A person's sexuality... ...is a personal thing. It has n. relevance in the business world. - But he is gay. - Oh, yeah. You know, it's oka. to call them queer again. Good to know. Good to know. Would it fair to assume tha. you've led him to believe that... ...you are of a similar persuasion. Not deliberately. I kind of sort of backed into it. - Excuse me. - Okay. Poor choice of words. When we first met, I found myself fallin. into his... What do you call it. Futon. No, no, his manne. of expressing himself. Tone, gestures. Like talking to a Southerner... ...you start saying "y'all" an. "grits" and "tobaccy.. - Oh, Charlie. - It's harmless. He throws me work. I wan. him to feel comfortable with me. And how far do you go t. make him feel comfortable. Don't worry. I just sparkle a little bit. I don't burst into flames. - I don't know how you live with yourself. - Actually, I don't live with myself. I have a significant other. - What. - We're both invited... ...to a cocktail party Saturday night. What. - No. Absolutely not. - Oh, come on. You always complai. we don't hang out. I didn't mean I wanted to date you. You don't think I'm gonna go to a ga. cocktail party stag, do you. The way I sparkle. I'm not going to be your gay love. so you can make a few bucks. Okay, first of all, it's considerabl. more than a few bucks. This man was responsible for almos. half my income last year. And that's the hal. I didn't gamble away. And second of all. you're not just my lover... ...you're my life partner. That makes you special. Forget it. It's immoral and deceitful. and I don't want any part of it. What's the big deal. Gay people pretend to be straight. They don't wanna be discriminated. And neither do I. The minute this gu. finds out I'm a breeder, I'm history. I don't care. If you wanna engag. in a fraudulent escapade... ...have one of your oafish poke. buddies be your partner. You see? You see? Right there. Escapade. Oafish. What poker budd. of mine talks like that. But you, a couple of squirts o. Paco Rabanne, you're good to go. Having a reasonabl. command of English... ...isn't the exclusive domai. of the gay community. Listen to you. You're just making my point. Forget it. You're asking too much. Oh, really. Was it too much when you showe. up on my doorstep, looking for a place. - Charlie. - Too much when I took in... ...your son on weekends and holidays. - This isn't fair. Too much whe. I set up a college fund for Jake. - You set up a college fund for Jake. - You bet I will. Unless, of course, my incom. were to suddenly decline. I can't believe you would sink so low. To actually use emotiona. and financial blackmail... - You're both in my will. - Really. First thing Monday. All right. But I want it on the record... ...I'm doing this under protest. - Noted. If we're gonna be a couple. I'm the husband. Well, who's gonna believ. you're the husband. Of the two of us, I'm th. only one who's been a husband. You really thought you wer. the husband in your marriage. Nevertheless, I'm going to b. the husband in this one. Well, la-di-da. - Thanks for babysitting, Rose. - My pleasure. Where are you guys going. To a little party. And you're taking Ala. instead of a date. Yeah, well, funny story about that. Okay, let's get this over with. You're wearing that. What's wrong with it. You liked it in the store. It looked different in the store. Well, it was on sale. I can't return it. - Dad, can we order pizza for dinner. - No. Eat something healthy. You want me to change, just tell me. - Don't change. - You don't like it. I didn't say that. I think you look very nice, Alan. Thank you. See. That's all I needed to hear. - Well, you heard it. Now, come on. - You know, I'm only doing this for you. - I know. - Could you show a little appreciation. How about I show you a littl. smack on the head. That's your answe. for everything, isn't it. What is that about. I don't know, but one of the. suffers from erectile dysfunction. Dad said we could order a pizza. Would you please not walk so far i. front of me? I'm not your concubine. I'm sorry. What, are you ashamed of me. A little bit. Oh, boy. Charlie, we need to talk. For the last time, you look stunning. No, we... We nee. to get our stories straight. - What stories. - We're a couple. How long have we been together. How did we meet. Okay, fine. I met you in Thailan. and bought you from a guy. I'm serious. If we're gonna pull this off. we need to be convincing. A favorite song. Cute names for each other. I mean, I don't even know i. we're dog people or cat people. I forgot to tell you: The guy I bought yo. from had your vocal chords removed. - Charlie. I'm so glad you could make it. - Oh, please. How could I not. And you must be Alan. Welcome. I'm the husband. No, he's not. Stop saying that. Listen to you two ladies. Come on. I'll get you a drink. Appletinis. So how did you lovebirds meet. Funny you should ask. We were at the Coffee Bean... ...you know, the one in Larchmon. Village, where the pastries are to die for. Anyway, we bot. ordered a soy latte... ...when the first one came up, we bot. reached for it, and our hands touched. Oh, that is so romantic. Yeah, it was one of those moment. that seems to go on forever. Like this one. - Are you starting. - No. Because I swear to God, I will wal. out that door and get in a cab. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, what. I'm sorry... ...pookie. Finish your story, Alan. Well, okay. So... So there we are... ...our hands are touching, and w. look into each other's eyes... ...this one panics, spills coffe. over one of his hideous bowling shirts. The only gay man in Americ. who dresses like Ralph Kramden. To the moon, Alan. Anyhoo, so I took him back to m. condo to "hand wash his shirt"... ...and, abracadabra. hocus-pocus, here we are. - That's a delicious story. - Yeah, isn't it yummy. Yeah, it kills me every time. There's someone you jus. have to meet. Don't go away. Okey-dokey, artichokey. You've gotta pull back a little. You're gonna set off the smoke alarm. - What do you mean. - I mean, if you flame any more... ...you'll light the drapes on fire. What about you. "Okey-dokey, artichokey". What are you, the Jolly Gay Giant. I want you both to meet someon. very special to me. Charlie, Alan... ...this is my very patien. and very forgiving ex-wife, Pamela. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Hi. Wow, you were married. It was before I'd gotte. a grip on my sexuality. But not before you go. a grip on my cousin Walt. Well, I can see why yo. gave marriage a shot. Pamela, you are . breathtakingly beautiful woman. Why, thank you, Charlie. Why do all the cute one. have to be married or gay. Back off, sister. I caught this fish. - Gonna tell me what's bothering you. - Lf you don't know, no point discussing. Fine. You ignored me the whole night. A party where I don't know anyone. and you abandoned me. Alan, listen closely. It wasn't a real date. Not the point. I was stuc. playing truth or dare... ...with your friend Eric and nin. producers from Will & Grace... ...while you had a wonderfu. time talking to his hot ex-wife. - I was just being polite. - Oh, please. - I saw the way you were looking at her. - What, I can't look. Not when you're suppose. to be with me. How many appletini. did you drink tonight. Never you mind about that. So... So, what are you gonna do. Out yourself as a straight man so yo. can sleep with your little Pamela. No, no. That would mes. everything up with Eric. Unless I convince him... ...that she temporaril. flipped me back to the home team. Oh, if you're gonna go, just go. Alan, eat something. Toast, a waffle. Anything absorbent. Don't blame this on the liquor. Okay, here's what I can do. She and I are goin. shopping tomorrow. I'll tell her I'm bisexual. and then make my move. So you're gonna cheat on me. No, that's not cheating. - How do you figure. - Because we're not really gay. Then how can you be bi. Shut up. Okay, well, good night. - Aren't you gonna ask. - No. Jake told me. Oh, this is a cute top. I'm more a bottom man myself. I'll bet you are. - Too slutty. - Haven't you heard. Slutty is the new black. Oh, you. . . . . Is there some special, young v*g1n. enthusiast you'll be taking that off for. I wish. Can you keep a little secret. I'm keeping a big one right now. I haven't been with a ma. in almost a year. Oh, no. Color me sympathetic. I don't miss dating. That's lies an. pretense. I do miss the s*x. Really? Well, what, specifically. do you miss? And tell me slowly. The feel of a man's hot breat. on the back of my neck. His rough hands pulling m. to him and just taking me. Of course, I don't need to tell you. No, but I'm so glad you did. Isn't it funny that I can only b. this honest with a gay man. Yeah, it's a riot. Straight men only want one thing, an. they'll tell any number of lies to get it. - The dogs. - Straight women are so competitive... ...they'll use anythin. you say against you. The bitches. Gay women only want one thing, an. they'll lie worse than straight men. Strange, becaus. they've already got it. Oh, you, come here. Oh, that's the other thing abou. gay men. You're so hilarious. Yeah, we're like clown. who smell nice. You know, these are pretty. It's pretty sheer. Eric hated it when h. could see my nipples. That a gay thing. Well, I can't speak for the community. but I myself am nutty for nipples. Let's try it on. Okey-dokey, artichokey. All right. Hold this. Okay. What do you think. With or without the bra. I don't know. You're the one with nipple issues. All right, then. Without. Yes. Definitely without. Am I starting to sag. What... I'm sorry. were you talking to me. Am I hanging a bit low. I don't know. Go like this. - Now go like this. - Stop it. Give me the blouse. I am a woman, Charles. - Wanna see my nipples. - No. Why not? You made me look at yours. God, you are so frisky. How does Alan ever put up with you. How does his mothe. put up with him. Oh, boy. Charles, didn't I ask you to confin. your debauchery to outlet stores. Pamela, this is my mother, Evelyn. Mom, this is Pamela. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Your son is adorable. That seems to b. the conventional wisdom. I met him and his partner last night. but we immediately hit it off. - I'm sorry. His partner. - Alan, his lover. His lover. God, I'm not outing you, am I. Oh, no, no, no. Mom know. all about me and Alan. Right, Mom. Of course. Alan's almos. like a son to me. My ex's parents were not supportiv. when he came out of the closet. Oh, what a shame. What does he do. He's in advertising. Charlie writes jingles for him. Oh, I see. One han. moisturizes the other. No, the only time Charli. was ever in the closet... ...was when he was a little bo. trying on my hats and underwear... ...belting out the entire scor. of Hello, Dolly. It was Mame, Mom. In fact, if anything, his lifestyl. has brought us even closer. We cook together. we shop together... ...we go to all kinds of partie. and charity events together. Come to think of it, I have entered u. in an Alzheimer's walkathon this Sunday. Sunday isn't really good for me. But you will be there anyway... ...because we support each other in al. our little causes, and you love me. Right. Right. Say it. I love you, Mom. And I love you too. Eight a.m. Sunday. I'll buy us matching tracksuits. It'll be cute. - Lovely to meet you, Pamela. - Bye. If I didn't know you were gay, meetin. your mother would've convinced me. Okay, that's it. I can't do this anymore. You can't stop shopping. I've gotta find you something slutty. I've already got somethin. slutty in my pants. - You're terrible. - Pamela, listen to me. I'm not gay. I am completely. 100 percent, militantly heterosexual... ...and I find you incredibly attractive. - Okay. I understand. - You do. - Of course. I went through this with Eric. He wanted badly to be straight. and he suffered so much before... ...he was able to finally accep. himself for who he is. Oh, no. I accept myself for wh. I am. I am a lying horndog. - Charlie. - Lf I were a straight man... ...would you find me attractive. - That's hypothetical. Play along. Humor me. If I were straight... I'd do you in a heartbeat. Oh, good. Come with me. Charlie, don't do this. You don't have to prove anything. Oh, but I do. Now, come here. You don't have to b. straight to be a good kisser. I know, I know. Just wait. Well.... Give me a minute. I'm under som. pressure here. I just saw my mother. Would it help if you thought of Alan. Oh, great. Why don't you jus. roll up a newspaper and hit it. Charlie, sweetheart, it's okay. No, it's not. I am a straight man. I've always been a straight man. and I'll always be a straight man. Well, you'll forgive me, darling. but you seem to have a gay man's pen1s. Come on, let's go look at shoes. It's a straight man's pen1s. It's just having a bad day. - Hey. - Oh, I thought you'd never come home. - We have to talk. - Not now. I need to drink beer, scratch my ass... ...and watch a whole bunc. of girl-on-girl p0rn. - Hello, Charlie. - Eric. What are you doing here. I came over to talk to you about . new account, and you weren't here, so... So he invited me to Big Su. for the weekend. It's not what it sounds like. Yes, it is. He looked into my eyes. told me I had a tight little breadbasket. No. Look, the other night at the party, ther. was a lot of friction between you... ...and I'm really sorry. Yeah, I'll bet you're really sorry. How do you expect m. to keep working for you. Gosh, I hope you will. I'll make it up to you. How? How could you possibl. make up for this incredible betrayal. - I'll get you more money. - Done. Get out. Bye, Alan. Thanks for the sweater. - He gave you a sweater. - Cashmere. Very stylish. And thank you. - For what? I didn't get you anything. - You stood up for our relationship. What relationship. Alan, we're not gay. No, but if we were, you wouldn'. let anybody steal me away. And I think that's sweet. You need to stop this. I was just trying to get mor. money out of him, and that's all. Whatever you say. Pookie. Is the breadbaske. the front or the back. - The back. - Oh, good. It wasn't just a line. Pick it up, Charlie. We're lagging. Gimme a break. I haven't even been to bed yet. Well, perhaps it's time for yo. to reexamine your club-hopping... ...popper-sniffing, disco lifestyle. I explained about that. It doesn't matter, darling. You're here, you're queer. I'm used to it

I'll talk to him. - I wish you would because... Wait, Alan. - Oh, oh, sorry. Alan, have you been badmouthing me. - Badmouthing you? To whom. - To Jake. Oh, to Jake. No. - Why. - His attitude towards me is disrespectful. I have to wonde. where he's getting it from. I assure you, I make it a poin. to speak well of you in front of our son. What about your brother. Oh, with Charlie. I'm completely honest. That is not what I meant. I know. Hey, Judith. Have you said derogatory thing. about me to Jake. No, why? Did you want me to. I don't understand his behavior. Ignoring me, avoiding me. acting like I'm the enemy. But you get why I'm doing it, right. I got it. I don't know what to say. He's not getting it from us. - Absolutely not. - It's your mother. - You talk to her. - No, I talked last time. - Choose you for it. - Odds. One, two, three, shoot. - Odds. You talk to her. - No. - Hey, but you said you were gonna... - I lied. Leave a message at the beep. Beep. I wish there were a better wa. to deal with Mom. There is, but we're bot. too pretty for jail. - What. - What. Mom's here. Charlie, did you hear me. Yeah, I just prefer to live in denial. Come on. We talked about this. We need to set an example. Fine, tell Mom I love her and... I don't wanna give her my cold. That is not going to help. Well, you gotta say it in front of Jake. No. Here is the plan. We'll stop actin. like we hate being with her... ...stop taking shots at her, and star. acting like we love and respect her. - All at once. - Come on. Your Uncle Charlie think. I don't see him... ...but Grandmommy sees everything. Mom, we didn't expec. to see you today. I have to come unannounce. because when I call first... ...there's no one hom. when I get here. I imagine that's only becaus. my cowardly sons are trying to avoid me. She's ruining the plan. Well, the important thing is we'r. all here, and we're happy to see you. - Right, Charlie. - Oh, happy isn't the word. - So, what's new, Mom. - Well, if you really care... - We do, we do. - We do. Next Sunday. I am receiving my gold blazer... ...from th. Westside Realtor's Association. - I am so proud of you. - That's great. Me too, Mom. It's the highest hono. the real-estate community can bestow. - I am so proud of you. - That's great. Me too, Mom. So I wanted to talk to yo. about the presentation ceremony. We'll be there. Tell us where and when. Well, next Sunday, 5:00. And I was hoping we could have it here. - Here. - Why here. - I mean, we love and respect you... - But why here. This isn't reall. a good house for parties. - Yeah, it's so big and close to the ocean. - Yeah. Come on. I can't very wel. throw a party for myself. This way everyone will get to se. how much my sons love and respect me. Anyway, here is the guest list. and also a suggested menu. Nothing fancy. Cocktails, buffet. Any questions. - No. - Good. Okay. Big kiss. Love you all. - Love you too, Mom. - Bye, Grandma. Relatives, huh. Can't live with them. can't turn them in for the reward. Excuse me, Berta, but we happe. to love our mother very much. - Right, Charlie. - Right. Jake, look. There's a pelican on the deck. Oh, cool. Are you happy. Now we have to throw a part. for your crazy-ass mother. - She's your mother too. - How do you know. - I could've been adopted. - You wish. I do. Now, what abou. this stupid party. Here. Maybe this'll help. "Daisy's Fishing Tackle and Live Bait". Turn it over. "Daisy's Classy Catering.. She's my sister. Her husband left. I'm trying to get her back on her feet. She runs a catering busines. and a bait shop. Not at the same time. There's no pelican. Hey, you Charlie. Maybe. - Who's asking. - I'm Daisy, the caterer. Your Berta's sister. Same mom. Dad's a little iffy. Berta said if I wanted a sho. of your bourbon, I had to ask you. - Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out. - Thanks. I don't usually drink before noon. but I'm going through a rough patch. Well, that's why they make bourbon. My husband left me for another woman. You know how I found out. - To tell you the truth... - Relax. It's rhetorical. They waved to me as they drov. my house out of the trailer park. - That's sad. - Yeah. I had that doublewide 11 years. Larry was with me for four. Six months of those were house arrest. so you can't give him credit for that. You know. I haven't gotten up to pee yet. Let me tell you something. Larry was nothing when I met him. He was working at some koshe. slaughterhouse out in Fontana... ...before they fired hi. for being mean to the cattle. What. The Jewish laws dictate tha. the animals have to be treated kindly... ...before they get whacked. Larry would taunt them. "Hey, hamburger. guess what's gonna happen to you.. Anyway, I picked him up off his sorry. unemployed ass. I gave him hair plugs. contact lenses, teeth. The b*st*rd dumped me for this tiny. little Korean manicurist... ...who huffs nail-polish remove. between appointments. Well, you give a guy hair and teeth. he's bound to hook up with trash. No, she was pretty hot. She had a spray-on tan. Botox up the yin-yang. Couldn't tell if she was 20 or 60. - Daisy. - In here. What the hell are you doing. Relax. It's not what you think. We're just having a drink. Good idea. You listen to me. Just because I got us this job... ...doesn't mea. I'm cooking by myself. I'm coming down there. And don't act like you're doing m. some big favor. Oh, excuse me for trying to hel. my broke, homeless, baby sister. I'm not homeless. I have a home. I just don't know where it's parked. I wouldn't be broke if you'd hav. paid me my share of Mama's estate. What estate? It was a shoebox... ...full of corn pads. used lottery tickets and insulin. It's the first I'm hearin. about the insulin. Excuse me, but shouldn't we be. you know... ...cooking somethin. for my mother's party. Hang on, Charlie. You know, I am sick of you insinuatin. that I stole all that crap Mama left me. She didn't leave it to you. You were jus. the first one back after she flatlined. Oh, and where were you. At some ashram in Oregon. I was learning from my gur. how to channel my spirit guide. Oh, please. You were humpin. a defrocked priest in the woods. How about stuffed mushrooms. Everybody loves those. You know, that's your proble. your whole life. You chase after losers. take care of them, fix them up... ...and then they hop o. the first manicurist out of town. You're jealous becaus. I've had love in my life. Yeah? You know what you go. in your life now? Squat. No husband, no one to do your nails. and blocks where your house used to be. I swear to God. One more word an. I'm gonna knock you on your keister. - Okay, okay, there's no reason... - Squat. - That's it. - Whoa, whoa, no. No, whoa! Stop! Berta. Berta. Give me the rolling pin. Is there a special plac. you'd like me to put it. I don't know what els. you want from me. I took you in. Gunther's in the garage. so you can have the couch. You spoil that dog. Anyway, I'm staying at a motel tonight. Good idea. Maybe you'll mee. your next husband on the walk there. - Can I have one of these. - No. I am just trying to be a good sister. No, you're tryin. to make me feel like crap. It's what you always do. - So I can eat this. - No. - Let him have one. - You don't know this kid. He never stops at one. He eats like a refugee. - Eat it. - Drop it. Hey, how's it going. Not good. Nice move, Tinkerbell. - Shut your hole and help me pick this up. - You pick it up. I'm going outside to meditate. - What's going on. - I'll tell you what's going on. You wanted that clow. to be nice to his mother. But did you think to say to him. "Clown, be nice to your mother". No, we had to throw a big part. for our mother... ...catered b. the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. That's it. I can't work like this. Well, you have to, Berta. We've got 50 people comin. in a couple of hours. - Don't tell me. Tell her. - Fine. Watch this. Hey! I'm meditating here. Jake, let's go pick up Grandma. - Charlie, you're in charge. - The hell I am. - Why pick her up. - Grandma likes to drink. - When grownups drink, they don't drive. - Good thing Uncle Charlie lives here. So, good luck. I'll see you tomorrow. No, wait. Berta, you can't leave. Don't worry. Your deposit's full. refundable in fishing tackle or live bait. I don't want a refund. I want you to make up with Daisy... ...so when my mother gets here, she'l. have something to eat besides my soul. Make up with her. For what? Trying to help her. Trying to keep her from makin. the same stupid mistake again. Yeah, sure, fine, whatever. Just do it. No, I'm done with her. I quit. Berta... Berta, you can't quit bein. related to somebody. Believe me, I've tried. She is a spoiled, little princess... . . . . ...who doesn't kno. when somebody's trying to help. - And you know what else. - Hold on, hold on. I'm still trying to wra. my brain around "little princess.. Ever since Mom spit her out. she got everything she wanted. "We don't need to fix Berta's teeth. Daisy needs singing lessons.. "Why spend mone. on a prom dress for Berta... ...when Daisy needs tap shoes?. - That's rough, but... "Who cares if Berta need. her spine straightened?. "Daisy wants a nose job!. What if you went ahead and mad. a couple dozen of those little egg rolls. "So what if Berta's go. an extra big toe?. - Mom. - Oh, hello, boys. Why aren't you dressed. We came to pick you up. So you can drink. Oh, yes, well. I've decided to pass on the party. What? You can't pass. We've got people coming. decorations, caterers. And that's how you're dressed. Beats the hell out of a bathrobe. - Why don't you wanna go to your party. - Please, it isn't a party. It's a sham. None of those people are my friends. Why would you think that. Believe it or not, Alan, your mother i. a very sensitive woman... ...and I can feel when people around m. know that I hate them. Why did you want u. to throw the party. Oh, why does anyone want a party. To feel superio. while feigning humility. Don't touch that, Jake. Let me tell you something. The way you treat peopl. is the way they treat you back. Miserable bastards. But putting that aside. you're getting a gold jacket today... ...and we wante. to share that with you. Is that what it takes? I have to win a. award for my sons to notice I'm alive. Okay, you know what. Go, don't go. I don't care. If you wanna sit her. and stew in the venom and bile... ...that is the soup of your being. then fine. I hope you drown in it. Don't you ever tal. to your mother this way. Forget the party. I'll go back and tell those people... ...that the guest of honor could no. be bothered to show up. - Come on, Jake. - Oh, dear Lord. Alan, wait. If this silly, little part. means that much to you, I'll go. Just let me get dressed. Oh, gee. Thanks, Mom. God, I hate being guilte. into doing things. And after all that, the loans. the bail, the kidney I gave her... ...which even though it wasn't mine. was still money out of pocket... ...did she appreciate my sacrifices. I'm guessing no. She threw them away on chasin. after men with drinking problems... ...men with gambling problems. men with wooden legs and glass eyes. You wanna know why. Spare parts. Low self-esteem. I remembe. when we were little girls... ...she had this crus. on our cousin Jimmy... - He wasn't really our cousin. He was... - Stop, please! Enough. If you won't talk to her, I will. Finally. I was running out of stories. Daisy. Can I talk to you for a minute. Daisy is no longer inhabitin. this earthly vessel. Excuse me. I am Oxyquatzal. warrior priestess of the Aztec people. Okay. Let me ask you something. Do you know how to mak. those little hot dogs wrapped in pastry. Listen carefully. I have a message for Daisy. - Really. - She's wandered off the path of destiny. She must return. Alrighty, is there a numbe. where she can reach you. Tell her to follow her bliss... ...to stop squanderin. the gifts of the Great Spirit. - Got it. - Do you need to write that down. No, I got it. Path, bliss, spirit. - Great Spirit. - Sorry. "Great Spirit.. - Anything else. - No, that's it. - What do you want. - You're screwing with me, right. Get out of here. I'm trying to channel my spirit guide. OxyContin. Oxyquatzal. How d. you know about her. Oh, boy. Berta. Was Oxyquatzal here. What did she say. She said that the guest. are gonna be here soon... ...so you should make u. with your sister and finish cooking. No, she didn't. How do you know. Oxyquatzal is a 500-year-ol. Aztec warrior. Do you think she really care. about your dumb-ass party. Everybody likes a party. What did she really say, Chachi. She said that you have strayed fro. your path and to follow your bliss... ...which is catering, right. - No, I never liked catering. I only got into it because the bai. business was so damn competitive. What else. Something about squanderin. the gifts of the Great Spirit. Oh, man, that is heavy. For an ancient chick. she is so spot on. Well, no sense crying ove. squandered gifts. What do you sa. we go to the kitchen. What's the point. My life is hopeless. My dreams are dead. Yeah, but what if they weren't. - What do you mean. - Oh, I don't know. What if there was some wa. I could help you. You think you could whip u. some rumaki then. You don't even kno. what my dreams are. Oh, come on. Work with me, baby. I don't even know what rumaki is. Oh, gosh, Alan. I don't know about this. - Is my hair all right. - Mom, your hair looks perfect. You're impeccably dressed. you're fashionably late... ...and everybody is waiting for you. So, now, come on, let's walk in ther. and rub their noses in your success. Well, all right. - Alan. - What. You're blocking me. Rumaki. I will never, ever forgive you for this. One thing. One lousy thing I as. from my sons, and this is what I get. - Sorry. - Sorry. Not only was I roundly ignore. at my own party... ...but I listene. to a disturbed caterer belt out... ...the entire scor. of La Cage aux Folles. - Sorry. - Sorry. You should be sorry. We are.

episodeEpisode-04-Go Get Mommy's BrajþhEditor: Jk2writ. - Hey, Alan. - Yeah. You had the "just say no" tal. with Jake, right. Of course. Why. What talk did you have with him. No talk, it's just that he's... It'll be more fun if you see it. I'm guessing you don't mea. fun for me. Tell the truth. How proud do you feel at this moment. What the hell is he doing. I don't know. Ten bucks says he hits th. ceiling if we turn on the garbage disposal. - Jake, what are you doing. - Breathing. Breathing. Any particular reaso. you're doing that in the sink. I have to practice. Man, the girls are gonna love hi. when he grows up. - Jake. - Yes. - I'll bring him up. - Yeah. Hey, that's not funny. I could have drowned. And then we'd have found your bod. days later, washed up on the dish rack. - Where did you get all this snorkel stuff. - Greg bought it for me. - Greg. - Yeah, you know, Dr. Melnick... ...Mom's boyfriend. He's a real cool guy. He's gonna teach me how to scuba-div. after I learn to snorkel. We're gonna need a bigger sink. He's got a gigantic boat with bedroom. on it, and scuba tanks and wet suits. We're gonna go diving off Catalina. Wai. till you see the flippers he bought me. Well, Judith's boyfrien. sounds like quite a guy. - Yeah. - You okay with that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. This can be a sensitive are. for divorced guys. - I know. - Ex-wife sleeping with another man. - Son starting to bond with him. - Yeah. Yeah. - Big boat. - Charlie, what's your freaking point here. No point. Just drilling for the nerve. So, what do you think? You wanna g. bowling today? Maybe catch a movie. No, I'm gonna take another bath. He does know there's an ocea. out there, right. Well, Greg doesn't want hi. in the ocean. He wants him to spend tim. training in a pool. In fact, my son's a little unhapp. about being here... ...because he wanted to go snorkelin. in Greg's pool. He's got a boat and a pool. I guess you can affor. cool stuff... ...when you don't have to sell your bloo. and sperm to make alimony payments. Hey, hey, my relationship with my so. is not based on having cool stuff. And lucky for you. - Come on, look at the bright side. - What bright side, Charlie. Delineate the bright side. Maybe one weekend Greg will let u. take a couple of chicks out on the boat. Why on eart. would he lend us his boat. He's tight with Jake. we're tight with Jake. We've got an in. Are you not hearing my pain? My so. likes Judith's boyfriend better than me. Hey, I don't even know hi. and I like him better than you. You'd think I'd learn. Alan. Alan, your son loves you. You're a big influence on him. - You are the most important role model. - Oh, I guess. I mean, so what if you can't teach hi. to scuba-dive. For that matter. you can't teach him to ski... ...or hit a curve bal. or anything cool, really. But you bring plenty of other thing. to the table. Thank you, God. - Hello, Charlie. - Always a price, isn't there. - Hello, Alan. - Jake's taking a bath. As much as I'd love to spend tim. with my grandson, I'm in a hurry. Need to borrow your Mercedes. Well, since you're in a hurry. I'll give you a quick answer. No. Charlie, please. I'm showing a house in half an hour. What's wrong with tha. little electric car you bought. Nothing, it's fine. It's what anybod. who cares about this planet is driving. If you're trying to sell real estat. to a Saudi oil prince... ...you can't be driving up in some littl. toy car with a plug in the bumper. You could use my car, Mom. You see? Now, that is how a loving so. treats his mother. Thank you, sweetheart. but I need to look successful. - Charlie, your Mercedes. - No, forget it. - Charlie, I am not leaving until you give... - Happy motoring. Thank you. My car is in your driveway. And if you lose power. there's a kite and a key in the trunk. For the record, there are other way. of measuring success besides cars. You're right. There's boats and pools. You know what? I hope Mom puts a den. in your big, shiny, new Mercedes. Hey, don't say that. If you're gonna hope for something. hope she drives it off a cliff. So this is pretty cool, huh, Jake. An electric car. I guess. What happen. when the batteries run out. You plug it in and recharge it. But what if there's a blackout. You sit in the back sea. with a pistol... ...and wait for the looters. just like any other car. - Charlie. - It's a cool car, Jake. Greg has a really cool car. He has a Hummer. You know, your Uncle Charlie'. no stranger to Hummers. Charlie. That's a cool car too, Jake. So, Jake, this is pretty cool, huh. Driving in a futuristic car. going to see a movie. Hey, maybe afterward. we can go get some pizza. Sure. And then, who knows, maybe... Maybe your old dad will buy you... ...an excessively violent and blood. video game. How's that sound. Okay. You know. when we go scuba diving... ...Greg's gonna teach m. how to steer his boat. Well, I am sorry, Jake. but, you know, I don't have a boat. I don't have a Hummer, an. I don't know how to scuba-dive. It's okay, Dad. Greg does. Hey, Jake, how'd you like your da. to teach you how to drive a car. - What. - Really. Charlie, he's 11. So? We'll find an empty parking lot. - What if he hits something. - Alan, it's Mom's car. Guess what? Daddy's gonna teach yo. how to drive. Cool. Can you reach the pedals. - Yeah. Can we turn on the radio. - Forget the radio. Which one's the window squirter. Okay, forget the squirter. Now, come on, focus. This is your rear-view mirror. It's ver. important to check it before you back up. - Okay. - Now... Well, what do you see. The top of Uncle Charlie's head. A shopping cart, a tree, soda can. - Looks like Mountain Dew. - Okay. Forget the rear-view mirror. We're just... We're just gonna go forward. Now, you know, this is the brak. and this is the gas. Thought it was electric. He's got you there, Alan. Okay, this is the brak. and this is the electric. They're very, very sensitive. You don't have to press hard. Okay. Now, give it a little tap. - It is on. - No. - Brake! Brake! Brake. - Brake! Brake! Brake. Okay. Apparently it is on. - This is awesome. - You see how careful you have to be. And how much closer we ar. to the Dumpsters. - Can I squirt the windows now. - No. Now... Okay, why don't you tur. the wheel slightly to the left... ...and very gently press down on... Brake! Brake! Brake. Remember, if you wanna driv. Grandma's car again... ...you can't be telling her about it. - I know. Or Mom, or anybody else. Daddy doesn't need the grief. That was really cool, Dad. Thanks. - Yeah. Yeah, it was. - Hey, it just occurred to me. If Greg's here, we can ask hi. about going out on the boat. No, I'm not going to ask Gre. about going... Hi, Judith. Here he is, safe and sound. - Hey, honey. - Hey, Mom. Guess what we just did. - What. - Nothing in particular. That's a kids' joke. "Nothing in particular.. He's been doing it to us all weekend. - So, well, okay. Bye. - Alan. Alan. Ask about the boat. - Listen, next weekend... - Yeah, yeah. I know. You and Gre. are taking Jake scuba diving. No, that's the thing. Greg and I have decide. not to see each other. So if you haven't made any plans. you can have Jake. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'd love to have him. And I'm sorry to hea. about you and Greg. - Thank you. - Is there anything I can do. Yeah, you can wipe that smir. off your face. - Okay. Well... Well, bye. - Bye. She broke up with Gre. She broke up with Gre. She broke up with Gre. - Alan. - Yeah. Peephole. - Hey. - Where have you been. Car wash. They found somethin. real interesting in the back seat. Oh, yeah, what. Okay, now you're just showing off. No, Alan, I'm not. Although I have to admit. that is a sexy little item. - It is, isn't it. - Yeah, yeah. I'd like to meet the lady who fills this. Actually, you know her. - Oh, really? Lisa. - No. - Jennifer. - Who's Jennifer. Oh, right. No. Well, then who. I can tell you, but once I do. I can't untell you. - What are you talking about. - Who borrowed my car last weekend. Holy mother of God. No. No. Unholy mother of us. Mom in a car. Mom in my car. If I'd known this was gonna happen. I'd have gotten the vinyl seats. Wait. You're not just gonna leave i. in the middle of the floor, are you. Really creeps you out, doesn't it. - No. - Then pick it up. Hello? Oh, oh, hi, Jake. What's up. Slow down there. Yeah. No, I know your mo. broke up with Greg. Yes. I understan. that you're very upset, but... . . . . Well, no, no. I can't come over there and pick you u. just because you're mad at your mother. Well... I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. Now, why don't you let m. speak to her. Yeah, Judith, hi. Look, I am trying to back you up here. No, I told him he had to work it ou. with you. No, no... Really. You think it would be bette. if he came over here to cool off. Okay, but... Well, bring him over, then. Well... No, I'll see you in a bit. - Jake's coming over. - Yeah, yeah. Apparently he's furious with his mothe. about this Greg thing. Well, that's understandable. He was jus. getting to know this amazing guy... ...who had a boat and a poo. and a Hummer. A guy who could teach hi. all sorts of cool stuff. And then his mother just rip. this wonderful man out of his life. Too soon. Hello. Everybody decent. Oh, hi, Mom. What a surprise. Well, I was in the neighborhoo. and I thought I'd drop by... ...and see how my son. are getting along. - Well, we're doing fine. - Yep, just fine. - Good. Jake. - He's... He's fine. Just dandy. Oh, the hell with it. I left a $300 bra in the back sea. of your Mercedes, and I want it back. Oh, my. How in heaven's nam. did that happen, Mother. - Well, if you must know... - I don't need to know. Oh, Alan, grow up. I sold a 12-million-dollar hous. and I wanted to celebrate. With the Saudi prince. Don't be ridiculous. He's got nine wive. and they're all like 11 years old. No, I was with the seller's realtor. Splitting that juicy commissio. made us both so hot... ...we barely made i. off the front lawn. Now, go get Mommy's bra. Oh, darling, that is just sick. Seek help. Hey. - Hey, what's going on. - My mom broke up with Greg. I heard. I'm gonna live here with you and Da. from now on. Wanna bet. - Why not. - Two reasons. Your mother loves you. and life is cruel. Wait, that may just be one reason. Well, maybe my dad can talk my mo. into getting back together with Greg. Enjoy fifth grade, kid. You're obviousl. gonna be there for a while. What am I supposed to do, Alan. I know how much he liked Greg... ...but that can't be the reaso. for me to keep seeing him. I understand. You're not wrong here. I'm not? Because I certainly feel wrong. I failed as a wife. I'm failing as a mother. I even blew it as a lesbian. That might have been the problem. You're not a failure. We're both at faul. for the marriage not working. You're a great mother. And I'm sure yo. would have made a heck of a lesbian... ...if you just hung in ther. a little longer. I'm gonna take Jake ou. so you guys can talk. - Thank you. - Thanks, Charlie. - Where we going. - I gotta trade in my car. Why are you trading this car in. Didn't you just get it. Yeah, but there's a banging nois. that's driving me crazy. I don't hear anything. You're not in my head. Hey, as long as you're getting rid of it. mind if I take it for a little spin. Get real. I promise I'll go really slow. Forget it. It's not gonna happen. Is that a footprint up there. I never should have brought Jak. into the relationship. It was too soon. Don't be too hard on yourself. So Greg didn't turn out to be the grea. guy you thought he was gonna be. Oh, he was a great guy. My God, Alan, he took my breath away. Our first night together he picked me u. and carried me to bed in his arms. Well, the point is you brought Jak. into the relationship too soon. Greg said I was too demanding. I am, aren't I. - I am a demanding, angry shrew. - Hey, hey. Don't say that. That... That is not who you are. That's just who you've become. But, you know, underneath it all... ...I can still see the frightened. neurotic girl... ...with the minor eating disorde. that I fell in love with. Oh, Alan. I don't get it. This is exactly like your other car. No, it's not. Listen. No banging. Well, I think you should have gotte. a cool car like Greg. Hey, do yourself a favo. and stop worshiping this dude. There's a guy in your lif. who's worth looking up to... ...and modeling yourself after. - Dad. - Okay, two guys. Well, I still don't understan. why my mom had to break up with Greg. It could have been worse. She coul. have married him and then broken up. When I was your age. I was already on my third stepfather. And I kind of liked the second one. Well, how did you feel. How do you think I felt. I was pissed off. - Yeah, well, so am I. - And I'm not saying you shouldn't be... ...but you can't blame your mother. She's gotta do what's right for her. - You understand. - I guess. Good. The next time you see her. give her a big hug... ...and let her know that there's stil. one guy who's willing to live with her. Okay. Wait, you blame your mo. for everything. That's different. My mom's Satan. Come on, let's go boat shopping. If I'm old enough to drive... ...I'm old enough to kno. what's going on with you and Mom. You're not old enough to drive. I don't believe that you were carryin. her because she twisted her ankle. Believe what you want. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Tell him, Charlie. Your parents were about to have s*. when we walked in. Yeah, right

You look like a woman o. discriminating taste... ...and mixing a qualit. bourbon with ginger ale... ...is like putting Cheez Whi. on lobster Newburgh. Well, what if I sai. the Jack and ginger was for me. Well, then, I'd learn to live with it. - Charlie. - Gail. Sorry I'm late. I stopped off at Radi. Barn, and wait till you see what I got. Alan, I'm kind of in the middle of... Damn you to hell. - What? What did I do. - Forget it. It's who you are. you can't help yourself. Okay. Anyway, check this out. Know what that is. - A two megapixel, full-color webcam. - Right. How do I do it. I got one for me and for Jake. We can hook them to our computers... ...so when he's at his mother's. we can have video chats. - That's cool. - Isn't it. Yeah, with a couple of these, phone s*. becomes less phone and more s*x. These are to maintai. my relationship with Jake. It's the worst part of the divorce. - Only seeing him on weekends. - I get that. I sympathize. But you can see the validit. of my vision too, right. Oh, look. Built-in microphone. Totally hands-free. Perfect. - Excuse me. - Oh, hey, Gail. Good to see you again. Don't move, don't talk. - Are you Charlie Harper. - Yeah. Why. You were right. It's him. What...? What...? What's funny. Nothing. So listen, can I buy you a drink. He wants to buy me a drink. Then what? We go bac. to your beach house... ...sit on the deck, look at the stars, tal. about how you love being an uncle... ...and how you'. like kids of your own... ...and by the way, I have th. most beautiful eyes in the world. I'm sorry. Have we met before. No. And we're not gonna meet now. Okay. I have a bad feeling. Is the camera on. Good. Now, hit "connect.. I can see you. Can you see me. Yeah, yeah. I can hear you too. You can hang up the phone. This is awesome. - Yeah, we can see each other every day. - Cool. So... What's new. Nothing. What's new with you. Not much. - Hey, Charlie. - Rose, stop. - What. - We're friends now, right. Right. Our one-night stand is ancient history. You're not stalking me anymore, right. - Right. - Then use the damn stairs. - Really. - Yes. Okay. - I'm opening up the gate. - I'm proud of you. - I'm starting up the stairs. - You can do it. Oh, boy. I don't know about this. - You'll get used to it. - Yeah, we'll see. I'm surprised to see you home. - It's ladies' night at Pavlov's. - I know. Well, isn't that kind of lik. rabbit season for Elmer Fudd. Used to be. Let me ask you question. How much do chicks tal. about men they've been with. Not as much as you'd think. - Really. - Way more. - Why. - Well, I ran into some women last night. Never met them before. But they seem to have already forme. a poor opinion of me. So you think somebody's out ther. spreading nasty rumors. Worse. I think somebody's out ther. spreading the truth. Well, you have burne. a few bridges in this town. Hey, I don't burn bridges. I have casual s*x with relative strangers. There's a difference. And I'm always honest. I never lead a woman on. Unless I'm, you know, totally bombed. Last night was probably the resul. of one woman with an ax to grind. Probably. Yeah, that's it. - I'm making myself crazy over nothing. - Oh, I do that all the time. It's a great way to fill u. a slow weekend. Rose, that night we spent together... ...did I tell yo. you had beautiful eyes. Well, let's see. We had a coupl. of drinks, you invited me back here. We were sitting out on the deck. looking at the stars. And, yeah, you said. "By the way, you hav. the most beautiful eyes in the world.. I guess I do use that a lot. But, damn it, it's good. Are you sure it's not red. Look again. It looks fine. You have to go to school tomorrow. - Good night, Rose. - Night, Charlie. And don't forget to use the... Never mind. Oh, Charlie, Charlie. Come here. - Say hello to your Uncle Charlie. - Hey, Uncle Charlie. - Hi, Jake. - I can see you. I can see you too. So... What's new. Not much. What's new with you. Nothing. Oh, wait. I Googled you... ... and you'll never gues. what I found. Jake, are you in the bathtub. Yeah. Gotta go. No, no, no. Wait, Jake. what are you talking about. - What's he talking about. - I don't know. But if you Google me. you'll find pages that mention... ...my San Fernando Valle. Chiropractor of the Year award. That's nice. Get out of the way. Oh, careful. There's anothe. Alan J. Harper. He's a school bus driver, and he als. makes these decorative pigs... ...out of bleach bottle. and pipe cleaners. I'm not Googling you. I'm Googling me. "CharlieHarperSucks. Com.. That's gotta be a differen. Charlie Harper. Okay. I have a bad feeling. Oh, boy. Oh, man. Oh, crap. - Are you still reading that thing. - How can I not. It's an entire websit. devoted to trashing me. Listen to this. "Has anybody had s*x with Charli. where he actually took his socks off?. That's just mean. I have bad circulation in my feet. They get cold. Check this out. Some girl posted audi. off her answering machine. Hey, it's me. I just wanted to tell yo. I had a great time last night. - And I'm looking forward... - Hello, Charlie. Yeah, hi. We weren 't together last night. Allison. No, Beth. Thursday. I had a great time with you Thursday. and I thought that may... Oh, Alan, what am I gonna do. Every woman in the cit. can see this stuff. Every woman in the world. Oh, God. Well, you know what they say. Any publicity is... Good publicity. No, no, no. What I do requires secrecy. I need shadows and darkness. I'm like a magician. If everybody knows how I do it. it ceases to be entertaining. "Frequently Asked Questions.. - Don't read that. - Yeah, right. Okay. Question. "How long can you expect to dat. Charlie after you have s*x with him?. Answer: " It depends how lat. you sleep the next morning.. Oh, come on. This is funny. You're just too close to it. This could be interesting. Question. "How does Charlie manag. to fake my orgasm?. All right, stop it. Move over. - What are you doing. - I've gotta fight back. Anybody can post on the message board. Why not me. - You're gonna post as yourself. - Don't be ridiculous. Everybody uses a screen name. "CharlieFreak219.. Too many. Okay. CharlieFreak180. "In my experience... ...Charlie has always been... ...a generous lover... ...compassionate, fun-Iovin. and sensitive.. There. That ought to brin. a little balance to the conversation. You really don't get the Internet. do you. Oh, look. I've got a response already. "Dear Freak: Are you just stupid... ...or did your skull bounce of. his headboard too many times?. Okay, I've had enough of this. - How do I delete this whole thing. - You can't delete a website. Only the person who created it can. - Well, how do I find out who created it. - Now, let's see. Come on. Okay. Okay, the domain is the property of . company in the Cayman Islands called. "Charlie Harper Sucks Limited.. Well, that's no help. Hey, you can buy T-shirt. and coffee mugs. "Add to cart.. No, Mom, it is not that simple. I am a single mother now. Dating is very complicated. I understand. No, I can 't go back to Alan. Of course I still love him. Hey, Alan. How long you think this Internet fa. is gonna last. - Okay. - What. Jake must've turned on his webca. before he went to school. I can see and hear Judit. talking to her mother on the phone. - Why can't she hear us. - Our side's turned off. Are you kidding? Alan would neve. take me back. How do I know. I just know. Okay, fine. I'll ask him. - She wants me back. - Yes, I will ask him. That's nice. It's all about you. Okay. Listen, Mom, I gotta get in the shower. I got it. Yes. All right. I'll call you later. Oh, man. - Charlie, I need to talk about this. - Me too. If I don't do somethin. about that website... ...I'm gonna have to chas. Amish broads. Judith wants to reconcile. I've dreamed about this... ...but now that it's here. I wonder if it's what I want. Whoever put up that site has to b. somebody I went out with at least once. It would be great for Jak. to have both parents in one house. . . . . And without alimony, I could sto. getting my hair cut at the barber college. I can eliminate married chicks. ones that don't speak English... ...and those to who. I was never properly introduced. I'll make a list of the pros and con. of going back to her. You know what. I'm gonna need to make a list. - I'm glad we talked. - I'm always here for you. Me too. Hi, Tina. Long time, huh. Charlie Harper. What do you want. I know things didn't end wel. between us, and... Really? I thought they ended perfectly. We spent a week in Canc?n. having great s*x every day. Flew back to L.A. You told me you'. call me tomorrow, and it's been... What do you know. A year and a half. - That long. - Oh, yeah. I guess time flies whe. you're the scum of the earth. Okay, I had that coming. I was thoughtless and insensitive, and . know I can never really make up for it... ...but I want you to know that I wa. wrong, and I'm really, truly sorry. - And.... - No "and.. I just wanted to apologize fo. being a jerk. I wanna make amends. - You really mean that, don't you. - I do. Absolutely. - You wanna come in for a cup of coffee. - Sure, I guess. So, seeing anybody. "Pro: No alimony. Con: No s*x.. "Pro: See Jake all the time. Con: See Judith all the time.. What are you doing? Give me that. - I'm sorry. It was just laying there. - That's private. Okay. I got another "pro" for you. - Yeah? What's that. - Lf you hook back up with Olive Oyl... ...I won't have to scrub your toile. anymore. Pro: No more Berta. You're not really thinking abou. going back, are you. I don't know. She wants to, but I'm torn. You're not torn. You're gutless. - Do you still love her. - Of course I do. I mean, you know, we've been thoug. a lot of things together. - She's the mother of my son. - Okay, listen to me, Zippy. If that's all it too. to make a marriage... ...I'd have a husban. for each of my tattoos. - You have tattoos. - Yeah. You wanna see them. No. You're overthinking this. When you. dog dies, you don't make a list. You bury him, plant a shrub on top... ...tell the kids he's running aroun. a farm, and move on. That's actually a very apt metaphor. My failed marriage is like a dead dog. But it serves as fertilizer for the shrub. which represents my new life. So if I try to revitalize the marriage... You know, digging up the dog. - Then I'm killing the shrub. which is me. Like you said, it's apt. Thank you, Berta. You're a very insightful woman. I know. In a just world. you'd be washing my shorts. Well, thanks, nevertheless. Last chance to see those tattoos. No thanks. I can make the Road Runne. do jumping jacks. That was a fun apology. Yeah, I really though. I was the one who deserved a spanking. - So you'll call me. - Count on it. Hey, not that I really care, but. do you happen to know... ...who started that silly website. No. I just found i. by Googling your name. Most women Googl. the guys they go out with, you know. Yeah, I've heard. - Well, I'll see you soon. - You better. Okay. That went well. Let's see. Who's next. Jake, why don't you go watc. some TV. I need to talk to your dad. Is this about the firecrackers. What firecrackers. I'll go watch TV. Come in, sit down. Thanks. Listen... - Boy, this is tough. - Okay, okay, maybe... ...I can make it easier for you. Judith... ...I will always love you... ...but there's no going back for me. I've learned a lot about mysel. in the last year, and I'm growing. And... And I wanna keep on growing. I will always cheris. what we had... ...but I have to fertilize my shrub. - What are you talking about. - It's Berta's metaphor. The... The bottom line is. I don't want to reconcile. Our marriage is over. Well, what makes you thin. I wanna reconcile. What did you wanna talk to me about. My mom wanted me to as. if Jake could spend a couple of weeks... ...with them this summer. - Oh, really. - That's what she wanted you to ask me. - Yes. You didn't tell her you loved me. you missed me. Well, I always tell her tha. to shut her up. And how the hell do you kno. what I talk to my mother about. Hey, look, Charlie's here. - Answer my question, Alan. - Hold on a second, Judith. - Charlie, what's wrong. - I've been making amends. Five amends in one afternoon. Well, technically, four. I had to fake the last one. - Charlie, Alan and I are talking. - Don't worry. I'll be out of your way as soo. as I check on something. They all denie. running the website... ...but at least I should hav. some good reviews now. Listen to this. "Charlie came over and apologized today. and, oh, what an apology it was. I take back everything nast. I ever said about him.. Not bad, huh. Here's another one. "He apologized to you today. He apologized to me too.. Okay, I have a bad feeling again. Alan, how do you know wha. I said to my mother. I didn't actually know. I surmised. I should go talk to Charlie. Hey, Dad, check it out. I can see my room on your computer. Okay, now I've got a bad feeling. My heart was in the right place, Rose. - I know. - All I wanted to do was apologize. - I had no ulterior motives. - I believe you. Thank you. Did I ever apologize to you. You mean, for our one-night stan. that kind of, sort of broke my heart. Yeah, for that. No, not really. Okay, well, I am truly sorry. You're a wonderful person. and you deserved better. Thank you, Charlie. - That's sweet. - I mean it. - What's that. - Oh, this. It's one of those ne. web browser, e-mail gadgets. Cool

showTwo-And-Half-MenjàgEditor: Jk2writ. - Have any homework this weekend. - A little. Why don't yo. get started on it tonight. But it's only Friday. I know, but if you do it tonight. you won't worry. I'm not worried. Hey. What are you guys up to tonight. - Jake's gonna do his homework. - Why. It's only Friday. Let me tell you somethin. about Charlie. He was a lousy student. He alway. put off doing his homework... ...and his grades reflected it. - Seems like he's doing okay now. - Go get your books. - I left my books at Mom's. - Fine. I'll have her bring them over. - Okay. They're in my bag. Go get them. Okay. Well, don't wait up. - Pretty confident, huh. - Yeah. Thus, the "don't wait up.. Didn't you meet this gir. a couple of days ago. Yup. So tonight's the night. You know, the three-day rule. That's the three-date rule. Three dates? That's crazy talk. All right. If you bring he. back here, please be discreet. Don't worry. First night's always at her place. - Is that another rule. - No. It's just a common courtesy. A woman's more relaxed an. comfortable in her own surroundings. Plus, the minute she falls asleep. I can hit the bricks. That's lovely. It's a sham. you don't work for Hallmark. Yeah, I'll bet those guy. get laid like crazy. - Goodnight, buddy. - Night. What happene. to my chicken nuggets. What are you talking about. You ate them. Now, stop procrastinatin. and do your homework. What does procrastinating mean. It means putting off stuf. that you have to do. - Can you use it in a sentence. - I just did. Oh, yeah. Did I tell you a bu. flew in my ear today. Charlie. - You asleep. - What? No. No. You. Listen, I have t. get up early tomorrow, so... - You want me to leave. - Do you mind. No, I'm cool either way. Stay or go. Okay. So I'm going. Thanks, you're a doll. You know, I actually prefe. waking up in my own bed. Personal little quirk. - You don't mind, right. - Not at all. Good. So this worked out wel. for all concerned, huh. It was fantastic. We'll have to do it again. Absolutely. - But not tonight. - No. - Okay. Well, I'll call you. - It's probably easier if I call you. Sure. Either way. - I call you, you call me. - I'll call you. Good. - So I guess I'll just let myself out. - Okay. Sherri, you asleep. Finally. - How was school this week. - Okay. - Any homework for the weekend. - Nope. - Really. - Okay, yes. Do we have to go through thi. every Friday. I'd rather we didn't. Curly fries. When I was your age. we didn't even have curly fries. We had to make d. with straight or crinkle cut. - What. - I'm just trying to distract you... ...while I steal your fries. - Hey. Jake, don't be selfish. Let him have one. So no date tonight. I though. I'd just hang with you guys. - What about that girl you're seeing. - Sherri? I'm playing that slow. Really? Do you mea. at a leisurely pace... ...or as if you wer. developmentally challenged. Oh, aren't you clever? Bite me. Alan, most beautiful wome. are used to guys... ...chasing after them. They expect it. Squeeze a little more ketchup on it. would you, buddy. However, if you hang bac. and stay cool... ...the women come to you. Well, not to you specifically. but you get the theory. Yeah, I'm not stupid. Just physically repellent... ...and inherently unlovable. Don't get snippy with me. I'm trying to teach you something. Hey, I agreed to one. If you're finished with dinner. get started on homework. I'm still hungry. He ate all my fries. You can have ice crea. when you've done your homework. Isn't that procrastinating. Go. Man, that kid guards his plat. like a one-armed inmate, doesn't he. Hello? Oh, hey, Sherri. How's it going. Tonight? No, I'm sorry, I can't. I've already got plans. How about tomorrow night. Oh, you've got plans. Okay. Well, Sunday. Monday. What about Tuesday. You know what. I'm looking at the wrong mont. in my date book. Tonight works. How about I pick you up at 8. Okay, I'll meet you at 7. How about Antonio's. The Oak Room it is. See you soon. - What just happened. - You were playing it slow. - Everything okay. - No, perfect, Stephan. Thanks. Always good to see you. I liked it too. So you must be a regular here. Yeah. Food's goo. and I bring a lot of clients. Speaking of which. it's getting kind of late. - I've got an early meeting tomorrow. - I'll get the check. I already took care of it. - When. - You were in the little boys' room. - That's not right. - It's fine. I asked you out. No big deal. No, you shouldn't call i. "the little boys' room.. - Sorry. - You're forgiven. So we can just go. If it's okay. I wanna go back to my place. Oh, great. I'll follow you. I don't think so, Charlie. I'm kind of tired. Okay. Well, how about this. I'll drive you home, carry you upstairs. tuck you into bed... ...kiss you good night, and jus. as you're drifting off to sleep... ...I will lick your bod. from head to toe. Lovely as that sounds. I'm gonna have to take a rain check. Okay. Yeah, I gues. it is getting kind of late. - It's almost 9. - Thanks for understanding. - Sure. Hey, we're okay, right. - Yeah. - Did I say something to upset you. - No. - Are you mad at me. - No. - Promise. - Yes. Do I sound like a big old girl. Why didn't you do this part. That's extra credit. You don't have to do it. - Why don't you do it anyway. - Because I don't have to. It shows that you're willin. to make an extra effort. But I'm not. - Do it anyway. - Why. If you spent as much tim. doing the work... ...as you do arguing about it. we'd be done. I am done. This is extra. - Hey. - Hey. You're home early. Alan, if you got something to say... ...why don't you jus. come out and say it. You're home early. Yeah, that's smart. Keep pushing me. - Did you see that. - Yeah, he took my ice cream. Hey, neighbor. Hi, Rose. - Didn't you have dessert with Sherri. - How did you know I was with Sherri. Oh, Charlie, you still don't get me. do you. - So do you wanna talk about it. - No. She probably just ha. to get up early, like she said. Probably. Unless her real dat. didn't start until later... ...and she just didn't wanna eat alone. What. Oh, come on, Charlie. Double-booking. You practically invented it. No, she wouldn't do that to me. Why would she do that to me. Did she do that to me. She did that to me, didn't she. - Excuse me. - Sorry. I was just takin. a little selfish delight in your pain. The Germans call it "schadenfreude"... ...but here in the U.S.A.. we just go. - Thanks. - Oh, Charlie... ...you don't need a girl like that. You could do so much better. You're right. I can. She doesn't cal. when she says she will. She won't let me sleep over. She's obviously seeing other guys. So why can't I get he. out of my head. Okay, that's not where I was going. but let's review. She's gorgeous. but she's also self-centered... ...she's promiscuous. she's commitment-phobic... - Oh, my God. - What. I'm dating myself. No wonder the s*x is so good. Trust me. You'll feel bette. having this done. - We'll have the weekend to have fun. - What if we don't have fun. Then all this studyin. will be for nothing. That's just a risk we'll have to take. Now, what year did Magella. circumnavigate the globe. - It's not gonna be on the test. - Maybe not. It wouldn't hur. for you to know it. Why would I wanna kno. something I don't have to. Because maybe you'll nee. to know it in the future. Well, then, that's when I'll learn it. Why can't you just learn it now. There's onl. so much space in my brain... ...that if you put Magellan in there. I might forget my locker combination. - Charlie, help me out here. - What. Jake doesn't think he need. to know anything about Magellan. What's Magellan. Okay, I'm out of here. Won't be late. Oh, I'm sorry. Bad news from the clinic. No. I'm just takin. Sherri out for a nice dinner... ...after which I plan t. gently but firmly... ...extricate mysel. from the relationship. So she got bad news from the clinic. There's no bad news. There's no clinic. - I'm just ending it. - Why. Because she's a self-centered. manipulative narcissist. So are you. Hello. He said "narcissist.. It's not a dirty word. What does it mean. If you wanna know. look it up in the dictionary. Okay. He's not coming back. - Thank you, Steven. - It's "Stephan.. Sure, it is. Listen, Sherri, we need to talk. - You're a terrific woman, but... - You look so hot tonight. Really. . . . . - That was incredible. - Yeah, it was, wasn't it. It's funny how things work out. An hour ago I wasn'. feeling too good about us. I gotta get u. early again tomorrow. So if you don't mind... There you go, Elvis. Peanut butter and bananas. - My mom cuts it diagonally. - Yeah. Well, that's the wa. I learned to cut it in prison. Thank you. Alan, got a riddle for you. What's short, picky and onl. supposed to be here on weekends. I'll give you a hint: It's your kid. I know. I know. His mother decided... ...she had to go to Palm Spring. to rejuvenate herself. Detox. No, a health spa. Six hundred dollars a day... ...for meditation and colonics. How in the hell do you meditate... ...when someone'. squirting water up your business. I don't think the. happen simultaneously, Berta. That's good, becaus. it could be very distracting. I can't even pe. when the cat's watching me. Nobody answer the phone. Please, let it be her. Please, please, please. No, wait. Berta, you answer it. No, no, no! Let it ring. No, answer it. - Harper residence. - I'm not here. - Yeah, he's here. - Okay, I'm here. Jake, it's your mother. So how's it going down there. You struck oil yet. Charlie, what is going on with you. - What. - What do you mean, "what". You're spending half your tim. drinking and moping. The other half sleepin. and throwing up. You haven't bee. out of the house all week. You want m. to go out like this in public. If you feel so strongly about this girl. why don't you just call her. Yeah, sure, I could call her. I could also FedEx her my testicle. in a little silk bag. All the more reason to call firs. and give her a heads-up. Alan, don't you understand. This isn't about dating anymore. It's not even about s*x. It's about self-respect and pride. Yeah, well, I thin. that ship has sailed, Charlie. See, the problem i. she doesn't need me. So I need to figure ou. a way to show her... ...that I don't need her just as muc. as she doesn't need me. But without seeming needy. You see my dilemma. Actually, I think I do. You feel like I fel. when Judith kicked me out. All right, if you're gonna mock me. this conversation's over. - Who took my sandwich. - Go do your homework. Unbelievable. - I'm glad you were free tonight. - I'm glad I was home when you called. I would've called sooner. but it's been a crazy week. It's okay. I understand. - Oh, Charlie, I want you. - Are you sure. - Oh, yeah. - How much. - Can't you tell. - I wanna hear it. I need you. I ache for you. Okay, then. - What are you doing. - I've gotta get home. I got an early meeting. - What. - Beat you to it this time, didn't I. What are you talk...? What kin. of game are you playing here. The same game you're playing. only tonight, I win. Really? What is it that you're winning. Charlie, I'm lying here hungry fo. your body and you're walking away. So, what exactly is i. that you're winning. You know. - Get out. - It's too late. You can't kick me out. I already said I'm leaving. Hey. - So how'd it go. - Great. I took control. I regained my self-respect. I walked out of ther. with my head held high. Good for you. Good for you. So you're done beating yourself up. Not quite. Jake, wait till we get inside. I'm hungry. Uncle Charlie's in there. I see your point. At the risk of askin. a foolish question... ...you got any homewor. this weekend. - Nope. Did it at school. - Really. - Yup. Did it during detention. - Jake, why did you have detention. Because I didn'. do my homework yesterday. So you did yesterday's homewor. and today's homework. Yup. The extra-credit sectio. and everything. - Oh, great. I'll look it over. - Okay, I didn't do it. - Jake, why do you keep lying. - Because I thought you trusted me. The detention part was true. Hi, Charlie. Hey, Rose. What's going on. I just stopped by to say I'm sorr. things didn't work out... ...with you and Sherri. - Yeah. Thanks. And I'm sorry for m. schadenfreude the other day. I've been riddled wit. "glaukenschtuken" ever since. - Glauken.... - Schtuken. It means: " Feeling guilt. for having felt schadenfreude.. - They've got a word for that. - Not yet. But I'm hopin. "glaukenschtuken" catches on. I'll do my part. You know, something goo. did come out of all this. Watching you obsess over Sherri... ...really helped me understan. my obsession for you. I mean, you never return my calls. You always see other women. You never knowingl. let me sleep over. And yet, I've never been abl. to get you out of my head. - Interesting. - Isn't it. But now that I understand it. I feel somehow free of it. Well, that's great, Rose. It sound. like a real healthy breakthrough. Yeah. And the best part is no. that the fog of obsession has lifted... ...I can stop idealizing you. and see you for who you really are. And who would that be. An emotionally scarre. and deeply flawed human being. Who will one day bless me... ...with emotionally scarre. and deeply flawed children. Rose. Just hold me. I like the names Mike and Trudy

episode" Episode-01-Back off Mary PoppinsjrEditor: Jk2writ. The snap, the kick is up. and it is good! It is good. - Man. - Okay, well, that's the game. Dad, can I have my allowance. Sure. Here. Thanks. Here. Pleasure doing business with you. You're taking my son's allowanc. on a football bet. Hey, when he wins, I pay off. You know, minus the vig. Minus the vig. You're charging him fo. the privilege of making a bet. That's what the vig is, Dad. Face it. He's not gonna lear. this stuff in school. I don't care. Give him his allowance back. Fine. You get no allowance. That's your punishment for gambling. - Told you he'd do that. - Yeah, you did. Pleasure doing business with you. Hey, listen. After you drop him off at hi. mom's house tonight, do me a favor. - Just make yourself scarce, okay. - What's her name. Or is it too early to ask. It's not a girl. I'm just having friends over. Oh, poker? Oh, can I play. - I'm better than I used to be. - It's not poker. Wait. A flush beats a straight... ...and a full boat beats a flush, right. - Right... A full house and a full boa. are the same... ...so I won't sa. "full houseboat" anymore. - It's not poker, Alan. - Then what's going on. I'm just having som. friends over to smoke cigars... ...sample some fine single-malt Scotc. and, you know, talk. I enjoy all those things. Well, Scotch makes me a little gassy. But I'll take a Bean. and I'm good to go. That's nice, but I don't thin. you'd be comfortable. - Why not. - Because we talk about personal things. - You mean like a support group. - No, no, no. It's not a support group. It's just guys who get togethe. to talk about their lives. - That's a support group. - No, it's not. Okay, it's not. It's not. Got it. So why can't I come. Because these men are my friends. There's a level of trus. and confidentiality. - I'm your friend. - No, you're my brother. Wait a minute. You don't consider me a friend. It's not up to me. A friend is someone you choose. A brother is someone you get. - Excuse me. - There's no choice involved. Your dad just wakes you u. in the night and says. "Your mom wasn't really fa. and this isn't your room anymore.. So all these years. I've just been an intruder to you. An inconvenience? A burden. Well, sure. You can spin it that way. You know, I had no ide. you felt this way. I am very, very hurt. Okay. But you'll stil. make yourself scarce, right. - Bye, Uncle Charlie. - See you, buddy. - Oh, he's your buddy. - Alan, don't start. How is he your buddy. You didn't choose him. - I chose to let him stay here. - You chose to let me stay here too. No. I chose him, I got you. You know, there are time. I just loathe you. And yet you're surprise. I don't consider you a friend. Okay, have your real friend. to your little "support group.. - It is not... - It is a support group. It's a support group for weak. rudderless men. And I wouldn't be a part of i. if you begged me. Okay, bye. Dad, check this out. You can pick your friends... ...you can pick your nose. but you can't pick your friend's nose. - You know who told me that. - I can guess. Uncle Charlie. And you kno. why it's funny? Because it's true. Yeah, yeah. Have a nice week, Jake. Bye, Dad. Hi, Mom. Can I have my allowance. I missed you too, sweetie. - Thanks for dropping him by. - Judith, hold on. Do you consider us friends. I consider you my ex-husband. I know. But putting asid. for the moment... ...our loveless marriage an. messy divorce... ...we always had a certai. camaraderie, am I right. Can we talk some other time. I'm having people over for dinner. Oh, really? Anybody I know. - Sandra and Howard. - Oh, no kidding. Can I say hello. - I'd rather you didn't. - Why not. Sandra and Howard are my friends too. In fact, I introduced them to you. Well, why don't you call the. and invite them to your house. This is my house. Those were my friends. The fact is, you're havin. my friends for dinner in my house. Yes, Alan, that is exactl. what's happening. Well, when I'm right, I'm right. I've got something I wanna talk about. but it's gotta stay in this room. Everything stays in the room. Yeah, sure, Judas. Does that include veiled references... ...in one of your wise-ass songs. - I said sorry about that. - Too little, too late. We have to go through thi. every time we get together. - It's water under the bridge. - Thank you. It wouldn't have killed yo. to thank him in your Grammy speech. That I would've done, but, you know. Bacharach, he just went on so long. Well, get on with it. All right. How do I say this. Do any of you get up i. the middle of the night to pee. - Sure. - Occasionally. Sometimes, I don't even get up. This is what I can'. write songs about. Oh, drat. All right, look. It's not about peeing, per se. It's about getting older. I'm laying in bed with my wife. She looks beautiful, sexy. All I wanna do is finis. my Corn Pops and go to sleep. What are you doing. Shopping list. You know. just a shopping list. So you're sayin. the old flag's at half-mast. No, the old flag is fine. And I'd rather not refer to i. as an old flag, if you don't mind. No, my point is, it's abou. shifting priorities or something. Flag, drag, hag. I will knock your glasses throug. your eyeballs. I will do it. Let me tell you something, fellas. It doesn't matter what the calenda. says, you're as old as you feel. Me, I feel... ...like... ...boiled crap. - Hello. - Oh, man. I'm sorry, guys. It's my brother. We agreed you weren'. gonna be here. Don't worry. I just need my phone book. - Is that.... - Yes. - And that.... - Yeah. And that. He used to be. Not anymore. Him I don't recognize. He's our bookie. You can hav. your bookie, but not me. Bookies, like friends, are chosen. Okay. Okay, fine. I'm sorry to interrupt. I need my address boo. so I can call one of my friends. They don't care. Hurry up and get out. Hurry up and get out. Sounds like s*x with my ex-wife. I don't know if Charlie told you. but I'm recently divorced... ...and it's bee. kind of a rough road. - Here's your phone book. - Thank you. Of course, I guess in hindsight. I should have seen it coming, but... - I'm gonna count to three. - Bye. Sorry about that. He's ben. out of shape because I told him... ...he couldn't be part of the group. - Why not. You just saw him, didn't you. Trust me, he doesn't get any better. I mean, he actually think. this is a support group. This is a support group, Charlie. You're the only one who's pretendin. it's about Scotch and cigars. Whatever kind of group it is. we have rules about new guys joining. Well, but he's your brother. He's obviousl. going through a rough time. Seems like you should b. more supportive, pal. Hey, I support him plenty. I share my home with him. I share my food with him. I moved my foosball tabl. so he could park in my garage. What more do you peopl. want from me. Let me tell you somethin. about sharing, kid. Sharing is a two-way street. When you share wit. another human being... ...you always get bac. more than you gave. Assuming that you're smart enoug. to share with somebody... ...that's got more stuf. than you had in the beginning. Hey, Dick, it's Alan. How's it going, buddy. Oh, good, good. Listen. You maybe wann. catch a movie tonight. Oh, really? You and Roz ar. at Judith's too. Interesting. So in addition to my house. half my money, and my self-esteem... ...Judith got custody o. all my friends. No, no, no, I don't wann. take it up with her. I... Hi, Judith. No, no. I'm not trying t. ruin your party. In fact, I've got a little part. of my own. Alan, come back to bed. I'm cold. Be right there, baby. I gotta go, Judith. Bye. Well, that's a new personal low. You know, as long a. we're talking about getting older... ...I was at this club the other night. window-shopping. I realize I'm the oldes. guy in the bar. I mean, I still look good. But I'm competing for wome. with guys who are way younger. I gotta tell you, I felt kind of depressed. like maybe my best days are behind me. Oh, you're breaking my heart. There's maybe 11 women in this cit. who haven't saluted his old flag. We should talk abou. Charlie and his brother. What? Why. We've been meeting all these years an. I never even knew you had a brother. I didn't see that it was relevant. Let me tell you somethin. about relevant. The root of the word relevan. is "rel"... ...which is also the roo. of the word "relative.. Your brother is your relative, ergo. your brother is relevant. What. Another "rel" word is "relapse.. But I'll wait my turn. Hi. Is this Doug Ziskin. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Doug, it's Alan Harper. I'm your chiropractor. But I'm calling as a friend. Well, I'd like to think we are. Forget it. Sorry I woke you. Hey, neighbor. What are you doin. out here all by your Ionesome. . . . . Charlie's got some friends over an. I thought I'd give him some space. Oh, yeah. His support group. He claims it's not a support group. Oh, please. He also claim. he's not in love with me. What do you want, Rose. Nothing. I was just sittin. over there in Charlie's car... ...and thought you migh. like some company. From the minute the. brought him from the hospital... ...everything was about the baby. "Don't wake the baby. Don't teas. the baby. Don't paint the baby.. Then when he starts growing up. it gets worse. Everything he does. I get blamed for. He wakes up one morning with n. hair and one eyebrow, it's my fault. They find hi. tied to a street lamp... ...and big surprise. everybody's looking at me. Charlie, you need to stop resentin. your brother just for being born. Hey, I don't resent hi. for being born... ...but he abused the privilege. Even now, with you guys. I jumped through hoop. to get into this group. I had to be recommended. then I had to get to know you guys. Now Alan thinks he can waltz righ. in because he's my little brother. It's not fair. Let me tell you something about fair. What. Charlie, you know in your hear. the right thing to do. Fine. You want him so bad. I'll get him. You know, Sean never speak. about his siblings. All right, back off, Mary Poppins. You're working on my last nerve. Believe me, Alan, I understand ho. hurtful it is to be rejected by Charlie. And I found that the only way to ge. through it is to just love him more. That, and every so often, sneak int. his bedroom and try on his underwear. Helpful tip. Hello. - Oh, hello, Charlie. - Yeah, listen. I've been thinking. Why don't you take a Beano and com. back to the house and join the group. Oh, really. What changed your mind. I had a small stroke. What differenc. does it make? Get your ass back here. Well, did it occur to you that I might b. already otherwise engaged. - No. - Well, I am. It would be inconvenien. for me to return right now. Why? Where are you. Where am I. Well, that's none of your business. Are you in the garage. Oh, please. What on eart. would I be doing in the garage. Cut it out, Rose. You're being silly, Alan. Charlie is reaching out to you. Yeah, right. Last time he reached out... ...I wound up tied to a street lam. on Wilshire Boulevard. All right. Are you gonn. come back inside... ...or do I have to drag you i. by your big, flappy monkey ears. Listen to him, Alan. He's begging. No, thank you, Charlie. I am quite happ. chatting out here with Rose. Okay. I tried to be the loving brother. you sulky little weasel. That really wasn't necessary, Alan. Yes, it was. You're my friend. And friends don't just abandon friend. because something better comes along. Then this might sting a bit. I have something else to d. and I'm pretty sure it's better. All right, I asked him nicely. He said no. Let's move on. Coop, what's up with your fixation o. women who resemble Tobey Maguire. I think I finally got over that one. I went to see Spider-Man 2. Nothing. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the invite. I know I'm the new guy. So I'll hang back an. try not to disrupt the flow. So is there any protocol. I need to know about. Any customs, traditions. a talking stick. No, there's no talking stick. But there is a "shut the hell up" shoe. Okey-doke. As you were. All right, I've got somethin. I wanna share. The panic attacks have come back. and I just don't understand it. Everything is great. My career, my marriage. I should be on cloud nin. and instead of which... ...I've got this free-floating anxiet. and feeling of impending doom. And the diarrhea. Oh, I'm sorry. It's just tha. my panic attacks come with diarrhea. First the clammy hands, and then th. nausea, and then the aforementioned... ...you know. Sorry. I changed my mind. I want him gone. Can we shave his head an. fill his mouth with hair first. Let me tell you something about hair. The clammy hands. that's how it starts. Wait a minute. You can't just kick him out like that. You didn't want him her. in the first place. But I'm his brother. It's my right to reject him. You guys wanted him. Now tha. he's here, cut him a little slack. Can't you see. He doesn't fit in here. Of course not. He doesn't fit in anywhere. He's a weird little guy wh. makes phone calls from the garage. It's not his fault. His big brother didn't look after him. didn't teach him anything. I'm trying to make up for i. with his son... ...but thi. annoying little ship has sailed. Thank you, Charlie. You can stop now. No, I got your back. I want this twerp in the group. A problem with tha. is a problem with me. Oh, now you've got my back. - What. - A little late, don't you think. Alan, I'm defending you. And I'm asking where you've bee. for the past 35 years. Let me tell yo. what it was like growing up. Un-freaking-believable. What it was like to look up to... No, to worship someone... ...who on two occasions tried t. trade you for an underwater flashlight. It wasn't for keeps. No, no, no. It's my turn now, Charlie. All I ever wanted was his approval. his friendship. And all I ever got was my underwea. yanked up to the base of my skull. And the sad part is tha. I looked forward to the wedgies... ...because it was the only form of lov. that I could get from him. - That is sad, Charlie. - It's terrible. Charlie, don't you think there's somethin. you have to say to your brother. Yeah. Come here, buddy. Okay, buddy. Here's the ga. In the words of some wa. She loves my fla. Rally round the fla. Wow, Elvis, that was beautiful. But, you know, in all honesty... ...I really loved your earlier. you know, angrier stuff. You know, "Pump It Up.. Now, that was a song. I gave you that. Oh, and while we'r. on the subject, Sean... ...why don't yo. do funny stuff like you used to. I mean, Fast Times ruled, man. Come on, do a little Spicoli for us. Guys, this isn't funny. Clammy hands. Nausea. Guys. Hey, guys. Guys

showTwo-And-Half-Menj§`Editor: Jk2writ. That was very nice, Mindy. Okay. Jake, we're ready to hear your report. - Jake. - Just a sec. Now, Jake. Okay, I'm finished. - Does spelling and grammar count. - It's an oral report, Jake. Oh, so it's like an oral thermometer. Right. Good thing it's not a rectal report. - Just read it. - Okay. "My Weekend, by Jake Harper. Grade five, Mrs. Flanigan's class. Woodward Avenue Elementary School. located on Woodward Avenue.. I'm not counting words. Oh, good. "My weekend starts on Friday, whe. my mom takes me to my dad's house. Which is actuall. my Uncle Charlie's house. Who is my dad's brother. making him my uncle. His name is Charlie, which is wh. I call him my Uncle Charlie.. Anyway... "Even though my parents are divorced. they still get along.. - Hey, buddy. - Hey, Dad. - How was your week. - Just fine. - Bye, honey. - Bye, Mom. - Thanks for bringing him. - Bite me. What the hell... ...went on last weekend. - What are you talking about. When I brought him home Sunda. night and served him dinner... ...he tipped me with a $25 chi. from Caesars Palace... ...and told me I had a nice rack. Well, Judith... ...you do. That's not the point. Where'd he get the chip. Where is he learning this behavior. Hey, Judith. Looking good. Run away, run away. Did you give my son a $25 chip. - No, I did not give him a $25 chip. - Happy. He won it, fair and square. You couldn't run away. I don't care what you do on weekdays. But on weekends, remember you ar. a role model for an 11 -year-old boy. Oh, that's a bad idea. Who thought of that. I'm warning you. Things had bette. change or there will be consequences. Legal consequences. Got it. - Got it. - Goodbye. "There will be serious consequences. Legal consequences.. "I don't care what you d. during the week. But on the weekends. you're a role model.. I enjoy talking this way. As do I. "Friday night, I stayed up late. I watched all three Austin Powe. movies with my dad. We ate Chinese foo. and Buffalo wings. Dad fell asleep durin. The Spy Who Shagged Me... ...which, in my opinion. is the strongest of the trilogy. By the way. 'shag' means 's*x' in England.. Just read, Jake. That was a footnote. - Read. - Okay. "I woke up later with a stomachache... ...but felt better afte. I went to the bathroom.. If you know what I mean. - Jake. - What? It's not like I said. "I took a dump.. "Anyway, I tried to go back to slee. but I couldn 't. Probably because I was thirsty. So I went into the kitchen for wha. Uncle Charlie calls a 'virgin screwdriver. . But really it's just a glas. of orange juice. It was late, so I decide. to skip the glass.. Jake. Hang on. That one hurt a little. - What you doing. - Having a virgin screwdriver. - Want some. - No, thanks. I'm good. - What are you doing. - Watching TV. Why isn't it on. Because I've seen this one already. - Hey, you wanna hear a funny joke. - Sure. Why did the blond star. at the juice carton. I don't know. Why. "Cause the carton sai. 'concentrate.'. That's okay. I didn't get it either. "The next mornin. I was pretty hungry because.... I think you all know why. "So I had a bowl of cereal with my dad. and we made plans for the day.. - You wanna go to the museum. - No. I wanna watch TV. It's pretty windy out there. Wanna fly a kite. No. I wanna watch TV. - Hiking. - TV. - I'll get it. - TV. "We decided to watch TV.. - Hello. - Is your name Harper. - Yes. - Then this is for you. - Why'd you do that. - Why did you sleep with my wife. Charlie. Busy. I don't care. Open the door. - I've got company. - I know. And her husband's downstairs. Really. - You're married. - Yeah. I'm not in. You have to come and deal with him. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. I disagree. It's not up for debate. He knows you're here. Oh, man, I hate when this happens. This happens a lot. Not a lot, but enough to be a drag. Charlie, are you coming back to bed. - Yes. - Yes? No "yes.. There is an angry husban. in your living room. How angry. - Is he packing. - What. - Does he have a weapon. - L... He has a stick. That's not good. I could lose an eye. - Charlie! Come on. - Fine, I'll wrap it up here. - Give me 20 minutes. - Oh, no. A better idea. Wrap it up now. - Ten minutes. - Now. We got five minutes. "The weekend was going great, but the. something really bad happened.. - Hey. - Hello. - Who are you. - I'm Norman. I'm Jake. Have you seen my Game Boy. No. Have you seen my wife. No. Well, if you see it, let me know. Ditto. "I couldn 't believe it. I lost my Game Boy.. "I couldn't find my Game Bo. in the kitchen or living room... ...so I checked my bedroo. and my bathroom. Because, as you may recall, I'd spen. a lot of time in there the night before.. - He'll be right down. - Thank you. Can I get you a cup of coffee. Decaf. I'm already pretty enraged. Well, that's certainly understandable. I have cookies too. - I wouldn't say no to a cookie. - Good. Come on in the kitchen. I always find a nice cooki. can brighten up even the darkest day. Yeah, well, this better b. one hell of a cookie. - It's a nice house you got here. - Oh, thank you. Actually, it belongs to my... You live in the neighborhood. - Bel-Air. - Oh, that's nice too. Gated community. but the wife gets out anyway. Chews through her leash, huh. Hey, let me get you that cookie. You see like a nice fella. I'm sorry I hit you with my stick. Oh, that's okay. I'm sorry my brother is... That's okay. So women, huh. Can't live with them. That's all I got. - You married. - Divorced. - She sleep around. - No, mostly just slept. You're lucky. There's no pain greater than bein. betrayed by the woman you love. You know, these are really very tasty. Aren't they. - Good morning. - Oh, speaking of tasty cookies... ...Norman, this is Berta. - Hello. - What is this, a fix-up. No, no. Nothing like that. That's good. because I'd probably kill him. Nothing personal, Cotton Top. I just kind of like it rough. - Have another cookie. - Thank you. So is anybody gonna tell m. what's going on. Well, it's a little complicated. - Charlie... - Got it. Got it? How could you get it. There's a Rolls-Royce in the driveway... ...and I found thes. hanging on the mailbox... ...so I'm guessing that your brother'. got some bimbo upstairs... ...and Norman here is her dadd. or her sugar daddy. - Tell me I'm wrong. - I'm the husband. Judges. - You gotta give it to her. - Yes. - I mean, tough break. - Thank you. - You got a gun. - No. - Want one. - Berta. I'm making small talk. Okay. You wanna talk this out like gentlemen. or you.... You might've mentione. he fought at the Alamo. - No offense. - None taken. - Does that make us even. - You tell me. Okay. One more. How about that. - He poked you, you poked his... - Berta. What? How often do you se. that kind of symmetry in life. Hey. Hello. Were you just up i. Uncle Charlie's room. - Yeah. - Did you see my Game Boy. No. - Did you see my husband. - The old guy. - Yeah. - He's in the kitchen. Thanks. Well, that's weird. If I was a Game Boy. where would I be. I am so sorry. I had no idea that she was married. . . . . I have a firm rule when it come. to sleeping with married women. Yeah, if she's firm enough. he'll do her. Sorry. Isn't there somethin. you could clean. I'm guessing you coul. use a good scrubbing. Wait a minute. "And suddenly I realized... ...I might have left i. in my mom's car.. Hey, Mom, did I leav. my Game Boy in your car. Well, can you go look. Can't you just dry of. and put on a robe. There's another $25 chip in it for you. She wasn't wearing a ring. There was no mention of a husband. Is that supposed to cheer me up. - No, no, no. I just wanted you to know... - Now, now. I get it. You're a nice guy. and I married a skeevy tramp. No, no, no. I mean, yeah, I am a nice guy... ...but I'm sure Annett. is a lovely woman. Her name is Natalie. - Really? You sure. - Yes, I'm sure. Because I've been yellin. "Annette" all night. Her name is Natalie. Well, then maybe this is al. just a huge misunderstanding... ...and I've been upstair. doing someone else's wife. Five-foot six, long brown hair. butterfly tattoo on her left hip. Left hip, huh. Hold on now. A lot of women have butterfly tattoos. But the one I slept with also had a littl. beauty mark in a certain intimate place. I'm not here to claim a lost wallet. Okay, let's just assume it's her. Again, I am really sorry. It's my own fault anyway. I should've realize. back when I married her... ...a man my age couldn't satisf. a woman that young. If it makes you feel any better. I couldn't ring her bell, either. - You couldn't. - You don't know me... ...but there's things I don't kid about. So it's not just me. - That's a relief. - Tell me... ...about it. I was killing myself up there. So anyway... ...are we okay. You mean, aside from the fac. that you just rolled off my wife. Oh, yeah. We're aces. Good. Thank you. - Can I give you a little advice, kid. - Sure. I was a player once, like you. Do tell. Does the name Tuesday Wel. mean anything to you. No. Joey Heatherton. No. The immortal Miss Anne Francis. TV's Honey West. - Sorry. - Well, look them up on your Internet. They were all hot, and I nailed them. Really. Well, kudos. But nothing lasts forever. There's going to come a tim. when you'll wanna settle down. And I only hope you don't mak. the same mistake I did. I picked a young hottie... ...because I figured I'd die in the sac. with a smile on my face. That's my retirement plan. But it doesn't work that way. What happens is... ...you get your heart broken... ...and you wind up havin. coffee with some putz... ...who never heard of Honey West. Got it. Thanks for the advice. Well, I'll be getting home now. I got lawyers to call, locks to change. Maybe I'll stop at the market. pick up some of those cookies. - Here. Take the box. - Oh, thanks. Looks like I'm the big winne. around here today. - Hello? Anybody home. - Hello. - Hello. Who are you. - Norman. Oh, hello, Norman. I'm Evelyn. Is that your magnificent Rolls-Royc. out in the drive. Why, yes, it is. - Are you a friend of Charlie's. - No. But my wife is. Did my son polish your trophy wife. Well, you see. like a very intelligent man. I assume you had an airtight prenup. Bulletproof. You know what, Norman. You look a lot like my fifth husband. Really. How many times you been married. Four. Cookie. "When Grandma came over. I thought things couldn't get any worse. But instead of making me visit... ...she gave my dad money to take me. my uncle and Berta to the movies. We saw the Rob Schneider movi. where he plays a stupid guy. I had popcorn, nacho. and two jumbo red Slurpees. But as you know. you don't buy Slurpees. You rent them.. - Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. - Cool your jets. And if you can't cool them. point the nozzle away from me. Oh, God. Mom. - We can't go in right now. - Why not. Because I can't afford to send yo. to therapy for the rest of your life. What's going on. - Oh, God. - What? What, what, what. Good for Norman. That's getting right back on the horse. - There's a horse in there. - No, no. No horse. - Well, I still have to pee. - So go water that bush over there. "And so I did. And it just goes to show... ...it's alway. in the last place you look.. Very nice, Jake. "Then on Sunday. we all went out for breakfast... ...with Grandma and Uncle Norman. I had chocolate-chip pancake. with blueberry syrup and bacon. Dad had scrambled egg. but with no yolks. Just the whites. They looked like mashed potatoes. Then the kid next to us threw u. his waffles. It was awesome.. - So, what's new in school. - Almost got an A on my paper. What do you mean "almost". Got a C. Okay, that's... That's fine. That's an improvement. Minus. Still, here's your dollar. You're paying him for a C-minus. That was our deal. A buck for every C. a car for every A. - A car. - Safest bet in the world. - So, what was the report about. - What we did last weekend. - No kidding. - Yeah. And guess what else happened. Trevor Griffin saw a ginormous ra. in the cafeteria. Yeah, but about the paper. You wrote about everythin. that happened here last weekend. Well, everything but the boring stuff. Oh, this could be problematic. No, it's called "summarizing.. - Can I see it. - Sure. But it's at Mom's house. I gave it to her to read this weekend. He's 11. There's no way it stands up in court. Does this smell funny to you

He started drinking a lot. and lying around the house all day. Oh, no. I caught him in the showe. with some bimbo. Some guys, huh. Yeah. If I wanted that kind of life. I could have stayed with you. Good point. So, what are you doing for dinner. - You're shameless. - Thank you. - It's not a compliment. - Whatever. What are you doing for dinner. Charlie, a lot has changed. I know. I'm older and wiser. and you're hot and on the rebound. - Charlie. - Dinner tonight. I won't take no for an answer. Hey, lady. Lady, you forgot your baby. Charlie, it's not her baby. Shall we say 7. Just out of curiosity, what the hel. happened in your brother's bathroom. - Nothing. - Dad was wrestling on the floor... ...with a naked lady. The quiet ones are always the freaks. - Jake, I was not wrestling. - But she was naked. She was taking a shower. and I didn't know. When I reached to turn it off. she was startled. It was innocent and there's no reaso. to tell your mother, understand. Sure. By the way. you have to sign my math test. Okay. D minus. Jake, how do you get a D minus. How do you get wrappe. in a shower curtain... ...with a naked lady. - Did you show this to your mother. - No. - Why not. - I didn't catch her doing anything. Okay, I'll sign this. But you are gonna go stud. so this won't happen again. All right, but I wouldn'. get my hopes up. If you want something from Dad. now's a good time. Oh, Alan, I am having the best day. - Really? Do share it with me. - Remember Lisa. Oh, is that the girl who bitch-slappe. me in your shower this morning. No, that's Meegan... ...or Megan or Sue. Lisa is the woman that I asked to marry. but she married this other guy instead. They're divorced and we'r. having dinner. Isn't that great. I'd applaud, but my han. was bitten earlier. I'm sensing you're upset. Oh, no, no, no. Why would I be upset. I mean, besides the... The bite and the mild concussion... ...that I got from my head bouncin. off your bathroom floor... ...while your shower budd. was driving her knee into my groin. She wants to be a talk show host. I don't see it. Not with that voice. And to top it all off, my so. saw me entwined on the floor... ...with Meegan or Megan or Sue... ...and is now blackmailing me. Kid's a genius. Anyway, here's the wrinkle with Lisa. She's got a kid now. I'm not sure where I'm a. with having an instant family. I'm sorry. Are we don. with what's bothering me. I am. It's like talking to a horny chimp. Well, that was uncalled for. - So, what do you think. - About what. Lisa, me, the kid. Okay, let's see now. This is the same woma. you've broken up... ...and gotten back with for years, right. - Right. And she turned you dow. in order to marry somebody else. - Yes. - And then the marriage fell apart... ...and now she's got his baby. - Yeah. Sounds perfect. Go for it. Okay, don't think I don't kno. what you're doing. Are you gonna be okay. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's just nobody's taken a cra. in my car since college. Don't be such a baby. Hey, tell her. I'll change her diaper while your ca. airs out. Then you can take us home. But what if it happens again. Don't worry. I'll hold her ou. the window till we arrive. Thank you. Can I make you a nightcap. Charlie, I'm breastfeeding, remember. Oh, right, right. And may I say, on behal. of myself, the ma?tre d'... ...and the entire kitchen staff that foun. a reason to walk past our table. You're doing a hell of a job. Look at what a goo. poopie you made. Mommy's gonna get yo. all cleaned up. - Would you throw this away. - Sure. You didn't throw tha. on the beach, did you. No, no. I threw i. on my neighbor's deck. Long story. He started it. - So how we doing. - All done. Oh, good. Boy, you hear all these horror storie. about screaming babies... ...but she's not half bad. She's my little angel. Kind of weird, huh. You and me and a baby. Yeah. Not that the baby's weird. It's just the whole, you know, gestalt. You are so sweet. I know. Wanna go upstairs. - No, I have to go home. - Why. What do you mean, why. I have a baby. Okay, she can stay too. I can't spend the night. I didn't bring enough diapers... ...the bassinet. I don't have a breast pump. So? We'll do it the old-fashioned way. What are you gonna do, Charlie. Milk me. What kind of thing is that to say. What makes you think I'm read. to jump back into bed with you. I don't know. Because I'm sweet. You weren't ready when I was single. How are you gonn. handle me and a baby. Easy. I love babies, babies love me. Look how good I get along with Jake. Jake's 11. So? He was 10 when I met him. Gosh, they grow so quickly, don't they. - Okay, look. If you're serious... - I am. - Come over tomorrow night to our place. I'll make dinner, we'll see what happens. Or we go to your place now... ...having already eaten. and see what happens. Still incapable of delayin. gratification, aren't you. No, no, no, I've grown. I learned to put the need. of others before me. - Really. - Oh, yeah. Absolutely. The old thoughtless. selfish Charlie is gone... ...and I say good riddance to him. Now, come on. I'll take you home. - Charlie. - Yeah. The baby. This makes no sense. It's math. It makes perfect sense. Well, then I guess we'll jus. have to agree to disagree. No, you just have to do the work. Well, maybe I have a learning disability. or a syndrome of some sort. You don't have a learning disability. You're just lazy. Maybe that's the syndrome. See you later. And by "later,. I'm hoping tomorrow. Is there anything in your showe. I need to know about. Oh, come on. That's the mos. action you've had in months. I have a loose tooth. Can't you just be happy for me. The woman I love is back in my life. That's great. I'm thrilled. I can't eat apples. I'll bring you back som. applesauce from Lisa's. Her kid needs to lay of. the fiber anyway. Oh, yeah. How's that working out. With the kid? She's great. I love kids. Really? Tell me. How man. diapers have you changed so far. . . . . Well, none, actually. But I am credited with an assist. - Have you fed the baby. - No. - Dressed the baby? Bathed the baby. - No. What's your point, Alan. - Nothing. Have fun. - Thanks. I intend to. Don't think I don't kno. what you're doing. - What was that. - Coyotes, Charlie. Probably dropped her pacifier. I'll be right back. - No, no, no. You stay. I'll take care of it. - Really. Oh, yeah. No problem. I'm great with babies. Pacifier is the little nipple thing, right. Be right back. Hey, little baby, you decent. Okay, here's your pacifier, sweetie. Not as good as the real thing. am I right. Smells like one of u. just crapped our pants. I sure hope it's you. Let's take a look. Charlie? You okay. - What. - Is everything okay. Oh, yeah. Just a littl. diaper issue. I can take care of it. And then I'll be bac. to take care of you. Okay. Let's just take this thing off. Oh, sweet Lord. Did you have Thai foo. for dinner, or what. Man, Babe Ruth took smaller dumps. Do you need any help. What. Do you need any help. No, we're good. Okay. Now we wipe the tushy. Sorry. It's not you. It's me. Wipe it again. Third time's the charm. Little powder. Oh, that smells nice. Maybe a little powder for my tushy. Don 't tell your mommy. Charlie, I can hear you on the monitor. Oh, right. People of Earth... ... we mean you no harm. See? This one is wrong, this is wrong. Jake, you have to check your work. These are careless mistakes. Maybe I'm not careless. Maybe I ate lead paint as a child. - Here. Do it again. - Fine. Dad, are you and Mom related. I'm sorry. What. Well, if you marry your cousin. your kids will be stupid, right. Jake, you're not stupid. your mother's not my cousin... ...and you're not going anywher. until you do your homework. Like I have somewhere to go. There we go. You were a hungry little girl. Of course she was hungry. She must of dropped half he. body weight in that last diaper. What a good burp. Wasn't that a good burp, Charlie. Oh, yeah. Wait till yo. meet my nephew. He can belch the theme from Shaft. All right. Good night, sweetheart. Oh, there we go. Now, where were we. Oh, yeah. You know, I'm a little tired. Aren't you tired. - What's wrong. - Nothing. Was it the breastfeeding? Becaus. in the restaurant, it turned you on. I know, but there I wasn't on deck. So you don't wanna fool around. It's not that. I'm lookin. at the sexiest woman in the world... ...and all I can see is a Thermos. Charlie, there are things you do wit. your pen1s that aren't exactly a turn-on. You mean the puppet show. I thought you loved The Amazin. Adventures of Stretch Armstrong. That's not what I meant. Now, come on. Come to mama. Okay, time. "Come to mama. bums me a little. Can we make i. "Come to Catholic schoolgirl". Yes, Monsignor. Hallelujah. Here you go. Two sugars, no cream. Oh, perfect. And I don't mind saying. last night was none too shabby either. "Dear diary: Coffee perfect. s*x none too shabby.. You know what I mean. I can't remembe. why we kept breaking up. - You can't. - Well, I can. I was just being romantic. - What are you doing. - Putting on my pants. You're leaving already. No. So why are you puttin. on your pants, then. I don't know. Did you wanna wear them. Forget it. Hey, I've gotta go hom. sooner or later. - Go home whenever you want. - I can't leave... ...when you're in this mood. - What mood. This mood. Oh, just leave, Charlie. It's what you do best. No, it's what I do afte. I do what I do best. Oh, come on. I was just putting on my pants. - You wanna spend the day with us. - The whole day. - Here are your shoes. - Hang on a second. Is this some hormona. thing because of the baby. No, it's some kind o. stupid thing because you're stupid. Any time I don't behave the wa. you want, it's hormonal. Not every time, but yo. gotta admit there is a pattern. You know the pattern I see. Every time things start going well for us. you find an excuse to run. No, no, no. You push me away. How? How do I push you away. Like this. You pick a fight ove. nothing and say I can't commit. - You can't commit. - Hey, I can commit. Oh, yeah? Prove it. Fine. I'll start right now. I'm gonna stay here all day. - Really. - Really. We're talking a business day, right. - Hey. How did it go with Lisa. - I don't think it's gonna work out. Really? Even with the little bab. there to help smooth things along. It wasn't the baby. She has commitment issues. Oh, that's too bad. Hey, what's tha. splattered all over your shirt. Coffee and breast milk. What happened. Did Starbucks merge with Hooters. Hooterbucks. I'd like a double-D cup latte, please. Dad, you gotta sign this. Another D. Jake, what is wrong with you. Well, I have a theory. Oh, really? Another one. Do tell. I'm a crack baby. Kid's a genius

She used to hang ou. at the house all the time. Oh, yeah. Eckelberry Hound. Not a name she was fond of. Hey, I didn't make it up. I just spread it around. What about her. Oh, she called the alumni associatio. and tracked me down. How does that work? They let he. sniff one of your sweaters. She e-mailed me. She's in tow. on business, and I invited her over. Great. I'll get out of your way. Just keep her off the good rug. Very funny. No. For you. information, it's not a date. She's just a friend who has becom. very successful in her field. Oh, that's nice that sh. has a field to run around in. - It's getting old, Charlie. - In people years or dog years. Sorry. Oh, look. You remember Miss Hanrahan. - Sure. I had her for sophomore English. - I had her in the teachers' lounge. Oh, that's Jamie. Be nice. I'm always nice. Ask Miss Hanrahan. - I'm serious. - Relax. I'm just gonna say hello... ...scratch her behind the ear. and then I'm out of here. - You done with the dog jokes. - Yes. - Good. - I hope she looks fetching. Okay, I guess I had one more. - Alan. - Jamie. Do you remember how Stuart Negelma. used to tell everybody you were gay. Don't remind me. I had one Boy George album... ...and suddenl. I'm queen of the fairies. You'll be happy to kno. I ran into him in New York. - And? Knew it. - Gay. Okay, here we go. Two margaritas. and a rum and Diet Coke. - Thank you, Charlie. - You're welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. So Stuart Negelman: Buttoned-down. or singing show tunes on a float. Very macho. Owns a gym in SoHo. Speaking of which, you loo. like you're in good shape. - I have kept up with the hacky sack. - Good for you. And you. I cannot get over wha. a beautiful woman you've become. - Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me. - Too bad. It's true. Charlie, that's lovely. You still play. Just professionally. - You became a musician. - More a composer. Gotta pay the bills. Play the jingle you wrote for th. feminine deodorant commercial. Okay. Fresh as a summer breez. Clean as a mountain sprin. No. You wrote that? I love that. Hey, hey, did I tell yo. that I was voted... ...Chiropractor of the Year by the Sa. Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association. Oh, that's fantastic, Alan. You must be very proud. Well, it's not pride so much as th. satisfaction I get from helping people. Carefree, so carefre. What every woman wants to b. Hey. Hey, you kno. what would be fun. A session of Dungeons & Dragons. Like the old days, you know. - Just the two of us. - Wow, I haven't played in years. Or we can go down to the beac. and go for a swim. - I didn't bring a suit. - So my plan is working. You know, I think I'll take a rain check. Do you mind if I use your restroom. Down the hall on the right. Thank you. Don't you have enough women. No. Anyway, you said sh. was just an old friend. Well, that was before I saw her. Come on, I spent year. laying the groundwork for this. And yet you never erecte. anything on the site. Because she didn't look like that then. Oh, shame on you, Alan Harper. Don't you know a woman is so muc. more than what's on the outside. She's a mountain spring. a summer breeze and I saw her first. What are you, 11. Come on. She's smart, she's beautiful. she's the kind of woman who... - You could never get. - Exactly. Well, if she's that important to you. She is, she is. Very much. - Okay, fine. I'm out of it. - Really. Happy birthday. Isn't that presumptuous? You think yo. can just give this woman as a gift. - Okay, forget it. - No, no. Happy birthday to me. Listen, I have an early meeting in th. morning, so I should probably get going. Oh, no, no. The night is so young. and Charlie was just leaving. Yeah, if I don't start drinking now. I'll be up all night. I really have to get going. What about dinner tomorrow night. - That would be great. - Okay, terrific. Why don't the three of u. meet at 7. The... The three of us. Oh, gee. Tomorrow night? I can't. Oh, come on, Charlie. I'm only in town for a few days. It wouldn't be the sam. without you. Right, Alan. That's... That's true. It would be different. But still good. No, no, no. You guys hav. a lot of catching up to do. I insist. Charlie, you have to come. Well, if it's okay with Alan... Of course. Okay, great. Then I wil. see you both tomorrow. - Okay. - Thank you. - Can't wait. - I know. Me too. Good night. Bye. So I'll get you something els. for your birthday. You like hookers. Charlie, we agreed you're out. Now stay out. - All right, fine. I won't go. - Thank you. Wait! If you don't come. she'll think I told you not to come. There is that possibility. That's your plan. To make m. look petty and insecure. Alan, I don't have to plan for that. Let me tell you something. You're comin. with us, whether you like it or not. All right. Wait. - We should take your new Mercedes. - Fine. - I should drive it so she thinks it's mine. - Okay. Wait. She'll never believ. I drive a Mercedes. You'll drive my old Volv. so that she thinks it's yours. Whatever. That just means you'l. be sitting in the backseat alone. Wait. Charlie, I can't believe that afte. all these years, you're still single. Well... It's not that hard to believe. I'm a selfish, promiscuous. commitment-phobic man. Alan, on the other hand, is a ver. generous, loyal, one-woman kind of guy. Guilty. Why doesn't that surprise me. Now, what is surprising... ...is to hear a man be so hones. and forthcoming about his flaws. Charlie, you ar. a real breath of fresh air. Guilty. But if you really want a breat. of fresh air, take a lungful of Alan. He is a true gentleman. Oh, Alan's always been a gentleman. I remember one time we were kids. W. were in my bedroom playing Stratego... ...and my blouse came unbuttoned. and Alan, instead of sneaking a peek... ...like a lot of guys would do, averte. his eyes and said, "Jamie, bosom.. Really. Is that true, Alan. Pretty much. We wer. playing Boggle, not Stratego. Well, there you go. A gentleman. A better man than I. Oh, don't put yourself down, Charlie. You seem like a wonderful man to me. Yeah, but you heard him. I'm better. Excuse me. I'll be right back. I think he wants to talk. You know, you are suc. a good brother. You have no idea. "Bosom". Forget that. What the hell are you doing. What? I'm trying to make you loo. good. Turns out it's not that easy. You look like you're tryin. to make me look good... ...but you're making you look good. I don't know how. but that's the net result. - Alan, you're being ridiculous. - Am I? I think not. From the minute we walked in. you've been sabotaging me. - How. - How? Look at where I'm sitting. - What? You wanted to sit next to her. - Yeah, and you let me. And now you get to stare into her eyes. and I get to stare into her ear. What do you want from me. Wanna change seats. Sure. That won't look suspicious. I'm just trying to help, Alan. Well, how about that? I do have to pee. You wanna help me. Stop talking me up. - It's killing me. - Okay. Stop putting yourself down. That's killing me too. - Got it. - Just sit there and eat your dinner... ...and I'll play your game. Fine. You wanna shake on it. You're disgusting. Yeah, I'm disgusting. At least I'm not the on. taking a squirt on my shoe. Let me tell you somethin. about my brother. He puts himself down. but he is truly a wonderful man. I mean, here's a guy. single, good-Iooking, talented... - Well, l... - You're too modest. Talented, a ton of money. And what does he do when his brothe. and nephew need a place to live. Does he complain about u. cramping his style? No. He opens up his home, and his heart. And frankly, I don't kno. which one is bigger. You are an incredible human being. Can we get the damn check, please. Wait till you meet Jake. He's a great kid. You're gonna love him. Right, Charlie. Don't oversell him, Alan. He mostly sits around and eats. What do you guys like to do together. Oh, we do all kind. of father-son things. - We go to the movies... - Where he sits and eats. And we also build models... You know, airplanes, an. fly them off the deck. - That sounds like fun. - Oh, it is. Jake loves it. I mean, he is a great kid. I can't wait to meet him. How about tomorrow afternoon. - Tomorrow sounds great. - Good, good. It's a date. - So don't be late. - Or we'll have to wait. Oh, okay. Here we are. Thank you so much. I had a wonderful time. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night. Good night, Charlie. Good night. To the Batcave, Alfred. Go to hell. I was just sitting here. I didn't put her tongue in my mouth. You got tongue. Actually, looking back. it was probably mine. Oh, relax. I'm just screwing with you. Besides, you're the on. who got the date. You had to pimp your ki. out to do it, but you got there. . . . . Hey, hey, there is nothing wron. with bragging on my son. He's a reflection of me. and if that compensates... ...for some of my social clumsiness... And maybe rustles up a little tail. I am not pimping him out. Don't bark at me. I'm proud of you. Thank you. And make yoursel. scarce tomorrow. - I don't need any more of your help. - Fine. You're on your own. Now, hush up and driv. Miss Daisy home. Okay, Sky Captain. Ready to go. I guess. See how he loves this. Pilot to copilot. Contact. What. - Contact. - Why are you talking like that. Just... Just start the engine. Here we go. Ready for liftoff. It's not a rocket ship, Dad. I know that, Jake. Hey, it actually works. Bring it up. Bring it up. - Okay. - Come on, Jake, up, up. It's... - Don't yell. - Give me that. - No, I'm doing it. - Well, then do it. I am. Is that it. No, go get it, and we'll patc. her back up, like we always do. Can we just orde. a pizza and watch TV. Go get the plane. This sucks. "This sucks." Isn't he a hoot. He's great. So... ...here we are. Yep. I just cannot get ove. how much you've changed. - You like. - Yeah, me like. I mean... I mean, I like. So... ...where's Charlie. This is all I could find. - Guess who that is. - No way. - Way. - What was going on with your hair. It's called a Jeri curl. It was my Michael Jackson period. Who's the tall guy next to you. Oh, that's me, Jake. Oh, sorry. Well, at least you look like a girl now. Thank you. Was Dad your boyfriend. Oh, no, no. Jamie and I were just friends. Yeah, we were never that way. Are you that way now. - Why don't you go watch TV. - Finally. You know, Jamie, I've been thinking. You're single. I'm single. Well, we have an awful lot in common. I mean, there's no reaso. we couldn't try to be... ...you know, more than friends. Is that something you'd want. Well... - Hey. - Oh, darn. - Sorry to intrude. - That's okay. It's good to see you. I thought you were gonna be busy. I was. I went to a movie. shot some pool... ...bought a book, bought a shirt, dran. a bucket of coffee, read the book. And then it occurred to me. "Hey, I have a home.. Hey, Dad, can you microwav. some popcorn for me. - Why can't you make it for yourself. - Remember what happened last time. You're old enough to mak. popcorn without starting a fire. Okay, I'll give it a shot. I'll be right back. So Jake's a great kid, isn't he. Yeah, I suppose. I would never say this to Alan, but . don't really care much for children. Well, the truth is, Alan'. not too fond of him either. He feeds the kid and keep. a roof over his head... ...but there's n. love lost between them. - Charlie, give it a rest. - Sorry. Why do you push me towards Alan... ...when it's obviou. how much you want me. He's got a birthday coming up. Just tell me you want me. Go ahead, Charlie. Tell her. What? No, no. You two, with th. Dungeons, the Dragons, the Boggle. You should be together. Clearly she wants you, so let's b. grown-up, and I'll get out of the way... ...so the two pretty people can mate. No, no, no, no. You laid the foundation... ...and you should, you know. lay the rest of it. I appreciate what you're trying to do. but I am stepping aside... - No, no. I'm stepping aside. - No, no. I am. No, no, I'll step aside. I will clear the way. Will you both just shut up. You're ruining everything. - Nice going. - Nice going. - Say it, Charlie. - Say what. Say that slick, cool, Charlie Harpe. finally wants Eckelberry Hound. - You knew about that name. - That name scarred me for life. It's the reason I haven't eate. a carbohydrate since college. - Well, you do look good. - You're damn right I look good... ...you smug, shallow son of a bitch. I have spent years workin. and sweating and dreaming... ...about the day that I would b. able to rub your smarmy nose in it. Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here. This is the signal, Charlie. You can't have this. Not now, not ever. Never, never, never. You know, I didn't make u. the Eckelberry Hound thing. But he did spread it around. I was always your friend. Oh, please. I spent year. throwing myself at you, friend. Playing stupid nerd game. on my bed with my shirt open, buddy. Hoping that you woul. kiss me or touch me... ...or at least notice m. as a woman, pal. - You knew your shirt was open. - Who do you think opened it. But I wasn't pretty enough for you. You wanted Donna DeMarco... ...or Maxine Chernikoff. just because they had big boobs... ...and no excess facial hair. Oh, yeah. Donna DeMarco. old Double D. Jamie, I had no idea. I am so sorry. But I was a stupid teenager. I guess I just didn't appreciate you then. I guess not. But that was a long time ago. I'm not a stupid teenager anymore. Do you think maybe you could forgiv. me, and maybe we could try again. Is that what you really want, Alan. Very much. Well, eat your heart out. You can never have this. Never, never, never. Well, I guess we kno. why she's still single. You're right, Dad. This is fun. Told you. It just takes a littl. while to get the hang of it. See if I can bring it in for a landing. Probably not a good idea. There's no real place to put it. What do you think Donna DeMarco'. doing these days

episode+)Episode-22-That Old Hose Bag is My MotherjbEditor: Jk2writ. Charlie? Where's Charlie. Check the living room. - Charlie, guess what. - Somebody call me. Not me. He's not in the living room. - Try his bedroom. - Thanks. Charlie, you gotta see this. Are you sure nobody's calling me. Wouldn't I tell you. Berta, he's not in his room. - What. - I said, he's not in his room. What. - Did you find him. - He's not up there. - Try Jake's room. - What'd he be doing in Jake's room. Hey, I'm just trying to help. I'm sorry. Charlie. I'm sure I heard something. I don't know what to tell you. I could do this all day. Charlie. Hey, Alan. - Didn't you hear me calling you. - Oh, that was you. Of course it was me. Who else would it be. Don't snap at me. I've been running all ove. looking for you. Well, I was right here. I know that now. Hey, that's no reaso. to have a hissy fit. Hissy fit? This is not a hissy fit. Say it higher, Alan. A couple of dog. in the neighborhood didn't hear you. I'm all done. I'm going home now. - Thank you. - Good night. Good night, my pets. Now that you've managed to find me. what do you want. There was something I was excite. to show you, but now I don't want to. - I'm okay with that. - So am I. Oh, come on. You gotta see this. All right. Fine. Hey. Wait a minute. Did Berta know you were out here. Very mature, Alan. Blame the maid. Oh, you bought a Porsche. "Porsche." What do you think. It's cute. What do you mean, cute. I mean, it looks like my car'. hot little girlfriend. Are you saying this is a chick car. Because it isn't. It's a Porsche. Yeah. The cute little one. No, no, no. It's the sporty one. If your sport is girls' basketball. No, no, it's got the fuel injection. and the rack and the pinion... ...and the leather thing. to cover the hood. That's called a bra, Alan. Yeah, but it's made of leather. - All right. Whatever. - It is not a chick car. The salesman showed me brochure. with pictures of guys driving it. Alan, if a monkey walke. into the dealership... ...he'd have been show. pictures of monkeys driving it. Monkeys can't drive a stick. Now, come on. We'll go for a spin, pick up Jake. Where'd you get the money for this. Where'd you get it... ...because they're not cheap. - No, no, they are not. Where'd you get the money for this. The money. Where'd you get it. Oh, I got it from... - What. - I got a loan from... Alan, where'd the money come from. I found it. - Alan. - Mom. You traded your soul for a Porsche. I didn't trade my soul. and it's "Porsche.. Alan, why didn't you come to me. No, I already owe you so much. You won't let me pay ren. and you pay all the utilities. Keeping that in mind. did you ever consider... ...taking the money from Mo. and paying me back. No, not really. Come on. Let me show yo. what this baby can do. Well, what do you know. Monkeys can drive a stick. You know, the salesman was right. You really do feel specia. in one of these things. Oh, yeah. Probably not a lo. of middle-aged, divorced guys... ...driving around L.A. In a Porsche. "Porsche.. Oh, wait, I forgot to show yo. the best part. Alan, that's a NASCAR hat. Yeah, they wer. out of the Porsche hats. I wanted something that said spee. and performance, so I got this. What you should be wearin. is a hat with a propeller on top. Come on, open her up. The first 1000 mile. is the break-in period. You're not supposed to go over 65. Well, then go 65. The speed limit is 60. You want me to get a ticket. Alan, you're drivin. an expensive red sports car. If you're not getting tickets and tail. you might as well take the bus. Which, by the way, just passed us. I am going plenty fast. thank you very much. Can we at least put the top down. No, I wanna trap the new-car smell i. as long as I can. Man, are you anal-retentive. You need a bumper sticker that reads. "My other car is a puckered rectum.. Oh, yeah. Like I'd desecrate this ca. with a bumper sticker. God, I love that sound. Will you stop it. Jake, your dad's here. Where's your car. Oh, my car? My car is... ...right there. - You got a Porsche. - "Porsche.. I have to struggle to make ends meet. and you can buy a Porsche. What are you talking about. Your ends have not only met... ...they've been to Hawai. and remodeled the kitchen. Don't change the subject. How can you afford a fancy car. Well, I can't afford it, really. Maybe I have to call my attorney. And re-examine our whol. alimony/child-support agreement. No, no, you don't. It wasn't very expensive. This is the girl version. Right, Charlie. Oh, yeah, yeah. You've gotta kiss i. before you can even stick the key in. Judith, you have nothing to worry about. You've successfully sucked me dry. Absolutely. This guy's farting dust. Then where'd he ge. the money for the car. He borrowed it from our mother. Give me a break. Even Alan's not that stupid. Oh, but he is. I am. I swear to God. - Hey, cool car. Is it yours. - Yeah. We're gonna have to tal. about my allowance. Okay, well, have a nice weekend. Wait a minute. That's a two-seater. Where's he gonna sit. And you didn't believ. he was that stupid. We're going way ove. the speed limit. Let me worry about that. You just keep looking for cops. I don't usually take a cab. I drive a red Boxster. You know, Porsche. - Those are very nice. - Thank you. My sister has one. - Hey, Berta. You seen my brother. - Did you check his room. Thanks. Sweetie, it is a beautiful car. Congratulations. - Thanks, Mom. I'm really enjoying it. - Well, your Aunt Sylvia loves hers. Berta, have you seen Charlie. Look out on the deck. - I was looking for you. - I was in the garage. - I was looking for you. - I was looking for Alan. I was in the garage. Okay. Bye. Oh, sure. Blame the maid. Oh, Alan, before I forget. I need to ask you for a little favor. Your soul, please. Charlie, for God's sake... Careful. I don't thin. you're allowed to say "God"... ...without bursting into flame. or something. Shush with your antichrist humor. It's getting old. Alan, I'd like you to join m. for dinner tomorrow night. - Why. - I'm dating a man I'd like you to meet. And. He has a lovely daughter about your age. Sayeth the serpent. No. Mom, please, please. please, no blind dates. Why not? She's a sweet gir. and I think you might really hit it off. - Why can't Charlie go out with her. - Hey, she didn't buy me a car. This has absolutely nothin. to do with the car. Besides, I wan. to get closer to this man. Should the time com. when I want an ugly breakup... ...I'll let yo. take a crack at his daughter. I'm sorry, Mom. But I'd rather not. Alan, I bought you a car. I love the smell of brimston. in the morning. Tomorrow night, 8:00, Le Pissoir. - I really appreciate this, darling. - Sure. Oh, one more thing. She's bee. through a rough patch lately... ...so we won't be ordering alcohol. Bye-bye. No, really. She sounds great. Looks like my mom and your da. are running a little late. Typical. Yeah. So you're in tow. for the weekend. Where do you live. Palm Springs. That's nice. How long have you lived there. Forty-two days, so far. Forty-two days. Yeah. This is my first weekend pass. I was supposed to get one at 30. but I bit a guy. - Would you like a cocktail. - No, no, no cocktails. No. - No, that's all right. You can have one. - No, I'm fine. - Oh, please. Go ahead. - No. I don't think... Order a drink, damn it. I wanna smell it. We're fine. Maybe just a fizzy water. So, what do you do. I'm a chiropractor. Really? Can you prescribe stuff. No. Did you hear that. - It's my phone. - Oh, thank God. Hello? Oh, hey, Mom. Where are you. Yes, she's here. Yes, very sweet. Where are you. Trudy, Trudy, there's no smoking. Oh, that's just great. Just jim-freaking-dandy. You guys are coming, right. Well, what am I supposed to do. Yes, I know you bought me a car. All right, all right. All right. Goodbye. Apparently, your father mixed u. his heart pills with his Viagra... ...and they didn't wann. waste the opportunity. So he's not coming. Well... Perfect. Just perfect. That son of a bitc. never cared about me. . . . . Trudy, Trudy... He'd rather spend the nigh. with some old hose bag. That old hose bag is my mother... ...and there's still no smoking in here. I'm sorry. Careful. I bit the last gu. who tried to touch me. Yeah, well, that doesn't mea. we can't have a nice meal. I'll call the waiter. Hello, hello. Yeah, we're ready to order. Remind me to get some clean urin. from you before we go. - Two hundred forty pounds... - What are you doing. Picking off the pepperonis. Then why'd you order i. with pepperonis. I like to stack them u. and eat them in bed. Hello? Hey, Mom. No, Dad's not here. He's on a date. Hang on. Uncle Charlie's talking to me. Yeah. Don't tell your mo. your father's on a date. - It's none of her business. - Okay. He's not on a date. Hang on. She wants to talk to you. Uncle Charlie's not here. Give me that. Hey, Judith. What's up. Well, he's not a bright kid. What do you want from me. I don't know where Alan is. Would you like m. to give him a message. Because who knows. Maybe this time I will. No message. How come it's a secre. Dad's on a date. It's not. It's just never a good idea to tel. women more than they need to know. How come. Because we love the. and want to protect them. A clueless woman is a happy woman. - Can I have your pepperonis. - No. Batman. Come on. Come on, Trudy. Come on. Come on. - Let's get you back to the Batcave... - Oh, right. ...or whatever cav. you crawled out of. Thank you, kind sir. You are indeed a gentleman. Allow me to reward you. A salty! I shall now need a slice of lim. and a carafe of tequila. No, thank you. No, no, we're fine. Hey, come on, Trudy. Let's take you home. Okay. But we'll have to b. really quiet... ...because my roommate is detoxing. so she's kind of a light sleeper. No, no, I meant home to your father. Oh, God. Daddy. Oh, I'm such a disappointment to you. Hey, your aftershave has alcohol in it. So why is Dad's car a chick car. It's not really. I was just saying tha. to bust his chops. Chops are your nuts, right. Right. Mom said it's a midlife-crisis car. Well, she was bound to be righ. about something eventually. What's a midlife crisis. Well, Jake, it's when a ma. starts facing his own mortality... ...and tries to recapture his youth. I've had one of those. Do tell. Life was so much simple. when I was 6. Hello? Hey, Dad. Listen, don't worr. about your midlife crisis. They usually go awa. over summer vacation. He wants to talk to you. Are you here. Yeah. Whoa, slow down. Well, how drunk is she. Really? Batman drunk. Well, just dump he. with Mom and her father. Where are they. Viagra and a bad ticker. Mom loses more boyfriends that way. Alan, calm down, calm down. Listen to me. Here's what you do. Take her to a club... ...pin a warning note on her bac. as a courtesy to the next guy... ...and run like hell. Well, if you don't want my advice. why'd you call me. Okay, how about this. Put the top dow. and let the night air sober her up. What's plan B. How come you don't hav. a date tonight. I decided I'd rather hang out with you. - Really. - No. You're saying that to bust my chops. No. - Hey. - Hey. - How was your date. - Oh, lots of fun. - Think you'll marry her. - Doubtful. Charlie. What happened. You take her to a club and ditch her. - No, I couldn't do that. - Why not. Well, it's cheesy and immoral... ...and I'm really not comfortabl. having some valet touch my car. - So where is she. - In the garage. - Oh, Alan. - Well, she passed out. - I figured I'd let her sleep it off. - You left her in your car. Why not. Well, at least she lef. the garage door open. It's a red Porsche Boxste. with dealer plates. "Porsche.. Yeah, about an hour ago. Hey, Dad, check it out. Your car's on TV. I'll call you back. - chase so far. The suspect wa. first spotted in Malibu... ... on the Pacific Coast Highway... ... and is now southboun. on the 405 freeway. Oh, God. Don't worry. I've watche. hundreds of these. They never make it. - she just ran over the nail strip. that the Highway Patrol laid out. Oh, man, look at the sparks. That's becaus. she's riding on rims, Jake. You gotta lik. how your car handles without tires. Oh, God. Whoa, that was a close call. She sideswiped that SU. and kept right on going. What's that draggin. alongside Dad's car. I think that's the door. - Cool. - Oh, God. Dale, this is Trish in the studio. Can you see the suspect. How do you know it's a woman. Well, Trish, we actuall. don 't know it's a woman... ... but thought it was a safe be. based on the type of car. It's not a chick car. Relax, Dad. He's just busting your chops

showTwo-And-Half-Menj§eEditor: Jk2writ. Tequila, checkbook, sourpuss. Must be alimony time. Go away, Charlie. Boy, you'd think for all that money, she'. at least come and give you a lap dance. - Leave me alone, Charlie. - In fact, you know what'd be funny. Where it says "memo,. write "lap dance.. Give her something to explai. at tax time. Charlie, you... Okay. - So where's Jake. - Sleeping at a friend's. - He'll get dropped off tomorrow. - Oh, man. - I rented a movie he'd like. - Oh, what'd you get. Don't worry. It's educational. One Million Years B. C.. How is this educational. Raquel Welch running from dinosaur. in a fur bikini. What is that if not history. I'm afraid you're gonna have t. watch it by yourself. Won't be the first time. What's the deal with that giraffe. How come you bring it out every tim. you write an alimony check. It's symbolic. Do you wanna kno. what it's symbolic of. No, I'm good. I made it in ceramics class for Judit. when we were dating. All these years I've been shelling ou. for tennis bracelets and satin underwear. Some women aren't impresse. with jewelry and lingerie. Well, sure, if you wann. date a dead girl. Hey, I just realized. Your name is Al, and you're sendin. your ex-wife money... ...so it's "Al-i-money.. Hey, hey, I just realized. your name is Charlie... ...and you're a moron. Be that as it may. If you gave her the giraffe. why do you have it. When Judith kicked me out. I wanted to get back at her. She took the house, she took the car. she took the money. - I felt I had to take something. - So you stole bric-a-brac. - Symbolic bric-a-brac. - Oh, right. You see, now every mont. when I write the check... ...I can look at it and remind myself... ...what a pathetic loser I am. No, dude. You don't nee. a giraffe for that. Get rid of the damn thing. You're killing yoursel. with this bitterness. What, you think I'm hurting mysel. more than her. No, I don't thin. you're hurting her at all. You need to move on, buddy. You're right. You're right. And you know what woul. be truly symbolic of that. Getting your knob shine. by a keno waitress in Laughlin. No. No. Me bringing this back to Judit. and apologizing for taking it. I like my idea better. Okay, here's the plan. I'll bring this little fella back to Judith. and clean the slate. Did you even consider my idea. - You drive. - Why do I have to go. Because I am obviousl. too drunk to drive. What does that say about your plan. Alan, wait. You can't stop me. I am giving Judith back the giraffe. Oh, I don't wanna stop you. I just want a good view. Okay, you can stay. Charlie, look at this. What is this. "The Harpers.. - Yeah, so. - She's not the Harpers anymore. She's the Harper. That mat is a complete lie. Yeah, and it's in cahoot. with the mailbox. Come on, ring the bell. You and me, we're the Harpers. Us. Oh, Alan. Hi. Dr. Melnick. Is Jake all right. I assume so. He's spending the night at a friend's. Oh, that's right, that's right. Dr. Melnick is Jake's pediatrician. so naturally, I thought... Oh, okay. Looks like somebody els. has given your wife the giraffe. Make sure they didn't forge. the garlic balls. What are you doing here. Why don't I just get back in the hot tu. and give you guys a minute. - Well. - I came to give you this. - What is it. - I made it for you. - Just now. - No, no, a long time ago. It's symbolic. Alan, you're a disturbed man. You need help. Enjoy those garlic balls. Wow, that was more fu. than I expected. - Come on, giraffe boy, I'll buy you a drink. - Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Our pediatrician. My ex-wife is sleepin. with our pediatrician. I wonder if she gets a lollipo. after every visit. You know, you're actuall. a very lucky man. Oh, really? Really? How am I lucky. Charlie? Show me the luck. Well, first of all. if Jake ever gets sick or hurt... ...free medical care is onl. a hot tub away. Well, that's true. He is good with kids. I begged her to do i. with me in the hot tub. She said it made her hair frizzy. Well, apparently, she's foun. the right conditioner. What if she's serious about this guy. What if she marries him. - Even better. - Better. How is it better? Show me the better. If she marries him. you're off the hook for alimony. That is better. In fact, if you saw the big picture. you'd encourage this relationship. This guy is a real catch for you. Don't let him get away. You're right. Maybe I should go back there... ...and, you know, bless their union. - No, no, no. You provided the woma. and the hot tub. - That's enough for one night. - Yeah, I guess. - Probably even paid for the garlic balls. - Yeah. - Could I get some more coffee, Berta. - Who's stopping you. Get your own damn coffee. - Well, Charlie, you're finally up. - Hey, Mom. - Where's my grandson. - He's at a sleepover. - He'll be here later. - And no one calls me. I wouldn't come over if I'd been tol. he wasn't here. Good to know. Where's your brother. His car's not in the driveway. Hey, Mom, I'm not even sur. where my pants are. All right. Well, looks like you and I get t. spend a little quality time together. Gee, I'd love to, but I got my regula. Sunday morning softball game. - Charlie. - Yeah. It's Saturday. Damn. - Oh, you're still here. - Yeah. - Listen, Alan, I'm really sorry about... - No, no, no. I should apologize to you. Showing up last night unannounced. That's completely inappropriate. And I came by to tell yo. it won't happen again. So you came over unannounced t. apologize for coming over unannounced. I was afraid you'd pick up on that. - Is Judith up yet. - Actually, she's not here. She ran to the market. Up and out this early on a Saturday. Good for her. She used to sleep a lo. when we were together. It was probably just the depressio. and the meds. - Meds. - Oh, no, it was nothing serious. Just your everyday little pink pil. to turn that frown upside down. Alan, I gotta tell you. this is a little awkward... No, please, don't feel awkward. Look, we're obviously goin. to be seeing each other a lot. There's no reason for anybod. to feel uncomfortable. That's a very mature attitude. Thank you. Well, you're welcome. So let me make you some coffee. Are we supposed to believe... ...that cavewomen waxed their leg. and wore fur bikinis. It's not a documentary, Mom. You know, I'm not gonn. be around forever... ...and the time will com. when you'll regret ignoring me. - Charlie, why do you hate me. - What. Whenever I come, you do everythin. you can to avoid spending time with me. Obviously not everything. We're spending time togethe. right now. You're just staring at the television. and it's not even on anymore. I can still see you. Charlie, look at me. - How long you wanna do this for. - I want you to talk to me. - Okay, I'm out of here. - No, no, wait, Berta. - Come, sit, talk. - Mommy-and-me time over already. - He hates me. - No, I don't. - Please, Berta, I need you. - I'm done. I wanna go home. - Berta, I'm begging you. - Oh, all right. So why do you hate your mother. Here we go. Coffee, juice, and my secret stas. of Mint Milanos... ...from the back of the freezer. Just a tip: If you want quality cookie. around here, you gotta hide them. Judith eats Pepperidge Far. like she's going to the chair. So tell me a little bit about yourself. Ever been married. - My wife passed away. - Oh, I'm so sorry. No alimony, though. Gotta love that. Hey, hey, here's a funny thing. My name's Al and... And I give Judith money. So it's... So it's alimony. - Wouldn't it be "Al-i-money". - I was afraid you'd pick up on that. - You got kids. - No. Well, that's a blessing. What with the dead wife and all. - Mint Milanos. - No, thank you. So anyway, kids. Hey, you know. it's not too late for you. Judith is a wonderful mother. We're not at that stag. in our relationship. Oh, of course not. On the other hand, you don't wann. wait too long. She's no spring chicken. You know, eggwise. So I'm having this nice Mother's Da. dinner with my slutty daughter... ...and her idiot boyfriend. . . . . Suddenly, the front door comes dow. and the room fills with tear gas. Next thing I know, I'm belly-u. on the floor, hacking out a lung... ...while the cops are dragging ou. Bonnie and Claude in handcuffs. Come to find out that the money tha. I loaned them to open a tanning salon... ...was used to turn my tool she. into a hydroponic pot farm. - Unbelievable. - Yeah. Your daughter came to visi. on Mother's Day. Sure, what ungrateful mutt doesn't visi. their mother on Mother's Day. - One year I forgot. Let it go. - When's my birthday. - Excuse me. - You heard me. - What's that got to do with anything. - You don't know your mother's birthday. - Well, not by heart. - Charlie. - What? She changes it all the time. - Just the year, not the day. Hey, I just realized something. I can leave. Fine. But before you go. just tell me one thing. - What. - Why do you hate me. Oh, Mom, for God's sakes, l... Rose. No, no, no. Rose, wait. Rose, come on in. Look, my mom's here. You like my mom. - Oh, sure. Hi, Evelyn. - Hello, dear. - Are those my pants. - Oh, no. I bought these. But I think this might b. your wallet and keys. Evelyn, you get younge. every time I see you. Oh, aren't you a dear. And thank you for the birthday card. - Oh, did you get it on time. - Yes, I did, and it was lovely. So sweet of you to remember me. How could anybod. forget your birthday. Well, yeah. You know, she does becom. a little emotional at times, huh. I thought she was getting ove. your divorce. No, no. She was over the divorc. while I was still packing. No, what you're seein. is low blood sugar. The trick to that is to always hav. some Fun Size Snickers in your pocket. - It'll perk her right up. - Really. Oh, yeah. Oh, and here's another tip. When she starts crying for no reason. and she will... ...never say, "Don't cry.. And try not to touch her. - Okay. - Or whistle. Never, ever whistle. Okay, maybe I forgot a birthday or two. Maybe I don't return every single call. But that doesn't mean I hate her. Was he breast-fed. Of course he was. Not by me personally. That's interesting. I see the bras that come through here... ...and he does tend to favo. the big yams. - I do not. - Oh, really. - Raquel Welch. - Hey, that's a damn fine film. Come to think of it. the night we were together... ...he did spend a freakish amount of tim. on my boobies. I mean, foreplay is one thing, but. golly, it was like making love to a cat. Rose, for God's sake. you're talking to my mother. Sorry. A very giving cat. He's always had an oral fixation. When he was little, he used t. suck on other children's thumbs. And now he's always got a bottl. of booze in his mouth. My therapist says that's his wa. of stuffing his feelings. - That's what my therapist says. - Hell, I could've told you that for free. - Hey, I'm here. - Hey, it's Jake. Back from his sleepover. Look who's here to see you, buddy. Hi, Grandma. Hello, sweetheart. Thank you for the lovely birthday card. - My mom picked it out. - Oh, and you love her, don't you. - Sure. - Thank you. You can go now. - Can I go too. - We're not done with you. - Where were we. - We were trying to figure out... ...why Charlie hates you. - Yeah. Well, Charlie. Okay, fine, here it is. I'm not saying I hate you. but if I did... ...it might have to do with the fact tha. you're a narcissistic bloodsucker... ...who drove my fathe. into an early grave. Then married a succession of men wh. couldn't care less about Alan and me... ...which was fine with you... ...because you looked at u. like dancing monkeys... ...you could just haul ou. whenever it suited you. And when it didn't, you sent us of. to boarding school or camp... ...or that kibbutz in Israel. where we got beat up... ...because we weren't even Jewish. And now, now you show up her. every chance you get... ...to lay a guilt trip on me... ...for not appreciating my cold. Ionely, loveless childhood. Well... ...obviously you're not read. to talk about it. - Alan, you really don't have to do this. - Hey, hey, I am a licensed chiropractor. If Jake had a sore throat, I'm sure you'. treat him, prescribe something. But it's nothing. I think I just slept wrong. Oh, that's probably becaus. you're not used to our bed. So have you...? Have you me. Judith's parents. - No. - Oh, they are just gonna love you. They were devastated by the divorce. Not to mention some of he. unfortunate choices thereafter. - Unfortunate choices. - Oh, you know, that's not important. What's important is they're just gonn. be relieved to see she's dating a man. You carry a lot of tension up here. Alan. - Didn't you just pay your alimony. - This is the pediatrician's bill. - Jake was sick. - No, no. The pediatrician had to se. an orthopedist. You know Mom's birthda. was a couple weeks ago. Yeah, I sent her some flower. and a card. Oh, man. Would it have killed yo. to put my name on the card. I did put your name on it. I wrote.

showTwo-And-Half-MenjâfEditor: Jk2writ. - What you doing. - I'm working. You're not gonna get much don. with the TV on. - What are you, my mother. - Your mother says that too. Listen, when you write musi. for a living... ...you have to wait for inspiration. Nope, not yet. Charlie, wanna com. to the movies with us. He can't. He's working. - On what, liver failure. - Wonderful. He's my mother, you're my doctor. Oh, I assume you finished readin. Lord of the Flies for your book report. Oh, good. How'd you like it. I thought it wa. a timeless American classic. I see. So tell me, what's it about. - You mean the book. - Yeah, the book. It's called Lord of the Flies... ...and it's about a really big fly... ...that all the other flies pray to. - And you thought he didn't read it. - Oh, I was just joking. It's more like Charlotte's Web. but from the fly's point of view. You've had more than a week. Why didn't you read the book. - I've been waiting for inspiration. - Attaboy. Okay, how's this for inspiration. We're not going to the movies... ...and you're not doing anythin. until you finish reading that book. - That's not fair. - Course it's fair. We had a deal. - You didn't keep your end of it. - Oh, so now two wrongs make a right. Bet you didn't see that one coming. You're really gonna like this boo. if you give it a chance. It's about kid. stranded on a deserted island. - How'd they get stranded. - Their plane crashes. Oh, really. And then what happens. This one kid named Ralph becomes thei. leader, and they form this society, and... Just read the book. - One big fly, huh. - Hey, I took a shot. Hi. - Charlie's working, Rose. - Oh, what about Jake. He's studying. - Hey, do you like smoked salmon. - I guess. Good. Then this is for you. - I don't know what to say. - Neither do I, most of the time. But then I start talking. and stuff just comes out. So, what are you doin. this fine Saturday night. I was supposed go to the movie. with Jake... ...but he didn'. do his homework, so... So you're punishing him by sitting ou. here all by yourself, alone and miserable. What a good dad. If you still wanna go to the movies. I'll go with you. - You and me? Like a...? Like a date. - Alan, are you asking me out. - I don't think so. - Okay. That was a little awkward. Come on, we'll catch an early show. Oh, all right. All right, why not. I'll sneak in the salmo. under my sweater. Good. That way, we don't have to pa. for that overpriced movie fish. - Hey. What you doing. - Working. How do you kno. when you're on a break. That's the thing about being a grownup. my little friend: You don't get breaks. Is this the ne. Oshikuru: Demon Samura?. - Yeah. - What are you doing with it. It's being turned into a cartoon, and the. asked me to write the theme song. - Awesome. - Yeah. - Wanna hear what I got so far. - Sure. So I'll be, like, the first kid in the worl. to hear this. Yep. Now, this is just a rough version. but you get an idea of the feel of it. Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikur. Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikur. My, oh, m. He's a demon samura. Who 's the guy who had to die. Oshikur. Boy. That really blows. Excuse me. - Did you even read the comic. - Yeah, I looked it over. Oh, really? What's it about. It's about this guy named Oshikuru. who dies... ...and comes back as a. what do you call it, samurai. - And he's a demon. - No. It's about a teenage bo. in a futuristic society... ...who's possessed by the tortured sou. of a feudal Japanese warrior... ...condemned to walk the eart. fighting the evil he once embodied. So, what's your point. He lives in a dark world. He battles the spirits of the damned. Your theme doesn'. capture the mood at all. It just blows. - Okay, okay, you said "blows" already. - Did I say "big baby chunks". All right, fine. Thanks for your input. Why don't you go read Lord of the Flies. and let me do my job. Well, if your job is ruining a grea. comic book, you can call it a night. - I heard that. - Good. Oh, no. What do you wanna be. Shrek here sits right in front of us. Don't worry. It'll be all right. You had to eat the chili cheeseburger. - That wasn't really necessary. - You'd have done the same thing for me. I'm not so sure. - So, Alan, tell me about yourself. - What would you like to know. Everything. I really don't kno. that much about you... ...aside from the fact that you'r. Charlie's brother and Jake's dad. Graduated from Cal State Long Beach. married your college sweetheart... ...and in the middle of the night, whe. you're half-asleep, you pee sitting down. - Have you been spying on me. - No, silly. I spy on Charlie. You just get in the way sometimes. You know what. Why don't you tell me about you. Well, okay. Well, let's see. I, too, pee sitting down. so we have that in common. I come from a wealthy family, so I gues. I've had kind of a sheltered life. You know, fancy private school. and colleges. - No kidding. - What college did you go to. Princeton. But just for two years. - Oh, so you dropped out. - No, I finished. Then I came back to Californi. to do my master's at Stanford. That's amazing. What's your degree in. Behavioral psychology. Hey, Jake. Jake, wake up. I want you to hear something. - What. - I've been working on the song. - Good for you. - Come on. Come listen to it. - I'm sleeping. - Sleep in school, like everybody else. I read the comic books cover to cover. I know the characters. I know their world. I think I got it. Listen. A teenage boy with the spirit insid. Of a samurai warrior who long ago die. Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikur. Oh, oh, oh, Oshikur. My, oh, m. He's a demon samura. Who 's the guy who had to die. Oshikur. Still blows. Yeah, well, you're still short. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry I'm late. We stoppe. for a bite to eat after the movie. - No problem. - An usher confiscated our fish. - Hey, can I play you something. - Sure. You know, I had a really good tim. with Rose. There's a lot more ther. than meets the eye. Yeah. Cool. Listen to this. Tell me what you think. A teenage boy with the spirit insid. Of a samurai warrior who long ago die. Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikur. Oh, oh, oh, Oshikur. My, oh, m. He's a demon samura. Who 's the guy who had to die. Oshikur. Very nice. It's snappy. - You really like it. - Yeah, yeah. Good work. Okay, that settles it. It blows. Berta, you know what's a good book. Lord of the Flies. Oh, yeah. I read tha. when I was about your age. - So, what'd you think. - I liked it. - It was like Survivor with kids. - Yeah. I agree. - Is Survivor spelled like it sounds. - Just read the damn book. - Morning, Berta. - Morning. Hey, did you know that Ros. has a master's degree in psychology. No. Did you know I'm . founding member of the Mile High Club. - Really. - Yeah. Me and Orville at Kitty Hawk. I'd have done Wilbur too, but we wer. only in the air for 90 seconds. Okay, you're kidding, and it's funny. But the truth is, you and . see each other every day... ...and we don't kno. much about each other. So you wanna know what goes o. underneath this gruff exterior. Whether somewhere inside me. there's a tiny little girl... ...who once dreamed of bein. a famous ballerina. - Is there. - Lf there is... ...it's because I accidentally ate on. and haven't passed her yet. Let me tell you. I am dreading that tiara. - Okay. Well, it was nice talking to you. - Hey, I feel closer. Oh, are you startin. that book report already. - Just making notes. - Good for you. What do you have so far. Lord of the Flies is kind of like Survivor. but with kids. That's an interesting analogy. What's your favorite part. When the first ki. gets voted off the island. Hey, all right. Stop trying to be friends with Berta. It just pisses her off. What doesn't. Hey, I was gonna do some shopping. and was hoping you could watch Jake. - Sure. - Ready when you are, Alan. - Be right there. I'll see you later. - No, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. - You're going out with Rose again. - No, I'm not "going out" with her. - We're just going shopping. - Morning, Charlie. You haven't forgotte. that she's a little bent, right. No, I think there's a lot more to he. than that. - Deep down, there's a good person. - Deep down, there's a few good people. And all of them are bent. - He'll be right with you, Rose. - Okay. - Charlie, everybody has flaws. - Flaws. She Superglued my testicle. to my thigh. That was the past. We've all done things we're ashamed of. She's not ashamed. She took a picture. then used it for her Christmas card. Thank God it was an extreme close-up. Most people thought it was a fruit bat. . . . . Okay, well. I appreciate your concern... ...but I think Rose is a sweet. smart, interesting woman. I enjoy spending time with her. Meet me out front. Okey-dokey. - Hey, what're you doing. - Reading Lord of the Flies. Not important. - Now, listen. You're a kid, right. - Yeah. Okay. I'm writing a song for kids. So assuming tha. what I've done already blows... - It does. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Assuming that, you need to help m. make it better. - But I have to do a book report. - Okay. I'll help you with the book report. You help me with the song. - Quid pro quo. - No. "Oshikuru.. Here you go. Raspberry-mango-banan. with a shot of wheatgrass. - Thank you. - My pleasure. You know, sometime. I like to come to the mall... ...and just watch people and make u. stories about who they are... ...and what their lives are like. - Oh, well, that's fun. What about that lady over there. What do you think her life is like. Well, I'd say she's a smart woman. but very Ionely. So used to rejection, it's becom. like the air she breathes... ...which is all the more sa. because she's got so much to give. Emotionally, spiritually, sexually. Especially sexually. She is ripe, smolderin. and willing to try anything. - What about that lady over there. - Her. Well, let's see. She's a little tougher to read. I'd say she's a smart woman. very Ionely. So used to rejection, it's becom. like the air she breathes... ...which is all the more sad... See, even though Oshikuru is for kids. it's not really a kids' comic. - It's very mature. - Okay, I think I got it. The demons Oshikuru fight. only exist... ...because they are a reflectio. of the tortured demons in his own soul. - Yes. - So, in essence... ...Oshikuru is like a Japanes. sci-fi version of Moby Dick. - What. - You said, "Moby Dick.. I mean, sure, being singl. can be Ionely sometimes... ...but it's better than being togethe. with someone you don't love or respect. - Is that what your marriage was like. - Well, according to my ex-wife, it was. Hey, as long as we're done here... ...why don't we take a driv. down to the beach and take a walk. - Alan, are you flirting with me. - Oh, no, no. I just thought, you know. since it's a beautiful day... If you are, it's okay. - Really. - Yeah. There's a lot more to yo. than I thought. - What did you think. - Oh, let's not spoil the moment. Okay. So, what do we do now. - Wanna try kissing. - Yes, I think we should. - Okay. - Yeah. - Wanna get a room. - Excuse me. Or we can go back to my place. unless you're afraid of ferrets. - Ferrets. - Yeah. I have five of the toothy little guys. No kidding. Five ferrets. - Those are like long, furry rats, right. - Yep. And they're all named Charlie. Of course they are. Well, as much as I woul. love to meet... ...Charlie and Charli. and Charlie and Charlie... - And Charlie. - Right. I can't help but wonder, is it wort. putting our friendship at risk. Well, that's a good question. Let's think about it for a minute. How good are you in bed. Because I'm excellent. Truthfully, I'm more o. an advanced intermediate. - Then let's stay friends. - Yeah, good idea. - Can I ask you a question. - Sure. What, specifically, turned you of. to the idea of a physical liaison. Was it the psychosexual fraternal rivalry. symbolized by the Charlie surrogates. Or the prospec. of being judged inadequate... ...by a woman who professes to hav. superior sexual skills. Wait a minute. Have you been doin. that behavioral psychology thing on me. No, don't be silly. But if I said yes, would tha. make you feel A, angry, or B, insecure. I thought you were gonn. write the report for me. No, Jake. That would be wrong. The only way to lear. is to do the work yourself. Now, these are called Cliff Notes. Inside is everything you need to kno. about Lord of the Flies. The themes, the characters. the symbolism. It's a book report waiting for yo. to put your name on it. Is that legal. Look around. Do you see any homework police. Oh, man. I give yo. way too much credit. Oh, I meant to ask you. how'd that book report turn out. - I got a D-minus. - D-minus. - Didn't you read the Cliff Notes. - That was 50 pages. Unbelievable. Your kid's too laz. to cheat. Has it occurred to you that mayb. he's too honest to cheat. No, I'm lazy. - Oshikuru: Demon Samurai. - Hey, it's on. Oh, oh, oh, Oshikur. Oh, oh, oh, Oshikur. My, oh, m. He's a demon samura. Who 's the guy who had to die. Oshikur. That's not what we wrote. That's your original, sucky version. What can I tell you. The network liked that one better. - What, are they brain-damaged. - Welcome to show business, kid. I still think it's snappy. Oshikur

season	Season-02jºpEditor: Jk2writ. Here. This is for you. Thank you. And I didn't get you anything. It's your kid's toilet seat. It's obviously in his way. and I'm tired of cleaning it. Oh, come on, Berta. - He's 11. - He's a pig. I'll talk to him. While you're at it. you may wanna mention... ...the half-eaten egg salad sandwiche. in his toy chest... ...the dead marine lif. at the back of the closet... ...and the booger collectio. under the bed. I'll do my bes. to address your concerns. Don't condescend to me, Zippy. I'll snap you like a butter bean. Excuse me. Is one of you Alan. I'm Alan. Oh, good. Charlie wants you to come upstairs. - Why. - Well, it's kind of hard to explain. - Try. - Oh, yeah, try. Well, he's kind of stuck. - In what. - In what. Not in anything, just stuck. Would you hurry. - Where are you going. - Oh, like I'm gonna miss this. Charlie? Are you okay. Do I look okay. - What happened. - I pulled my back. I didn't do anything. I was lying ther. and he started screaming. - I understand. - I mean, I wasn't just lying there. - I got it. - Damn, I wish I had a camera. That's okay. It's all on video. Alan, you're a chiropractor. Do something. Really? You want my help. Even after you referred t. my profession as, what was it... ..."urban voodoo". I'm sorry. Now help me. Okay. Okay. We'll see what we can do. Yeah, yeah, okay. very funny, very funny. Hold on. Berta, I'm gonna need a dead rooster. Check your kid's room. Excuse me, Charlie, sorry you'r. not feeling well, but I have an audition. - Go. - It's a Wheat Thins commercial. - I'm an actress. - Of course you are. I had a nice time, Charlie. - I'll call you. - Great. Oh, if you find my tongue stud. let me know. Okay, let's see what we've got here. - Is this tender. - A little. - On a scale of one to ten. - I don't know. Three. - Okay, what about this. - Four. And what about this. I'm gonna need a number, Charlie. No, no, I changed my mind. Leave me alone. Oh, don't be a baby. - Stay away. - I have to examine you. - It's okay. I'm better. - No, you're not. - Now, stop moving. - Really, I'm fine. Just don't... Ten. Ten. That's a ten. - Are you happy. - Do I look happy. Let's get you back on the be. so I can give you an adjustment. No, no, no, no. New plan. I need someon. who can give me drugs. I'm not holding. but I can make a couple calls. Drugs just mask the problem. Fine, mask it. Throw a cape on it. and let it fight crime. I just want it to go away. Good news. I think I know wher. Wheat Thins lost her tongue stud. For the love of God. Oh, mommy. Feeling better. No, I just passed out for a second. Berta, I'm gonna take Charli. to the doctor. - You keep an eye on Jake. - Fine. Whoa, hey. And please put his toilet seat back on. I really think you shoul. put on your seat belt. Do you now. Did you forget it took three of u. just to put on my shorts. Suit yourself. I should call your docto. and tell him we're coming. - What's his number. - I don't know. All right, I'll call directory assistance. What's his name? Where's he located. Dr. Schwartz. Beverly Hills. - You're kidding, right. - Do I look like I'm kidding. Well, I need a first name. I remember hi. receptionist's name. Julie. Cute redhead with a sligh. speech impediment. She called me "Charlie.. I almost asked her out once... ...but I couldn't fac. the inevitable phone calls. "I love you, Charlie. Don't leave me.. Yeah, yeah. and your doctor's first name is. Oh, I have no idea. Idiot. Yes, Beverly Hills, California. Dr. Schwartz. Yeah, I don't know the first name. No, I'm not kidding. There are 128 Dr. Schwartze. in Beverly Hills. What street is he on. Wilshire Boulevard, I think. Wilshire Boulevard, we think. Okay, we're down to 47 Schwartzes. Just forget it. Drive down Wilshire. I'll know the building when I see it. Never mind, we're gonna play... ...Find the Jewis. Doctor in Beverly Hills. Wait, wait. There it is. Now, you see. that wouldn't have happened... ...if you'd been wearing your seat belt. Alan, if I can ever use my legs again... ...the first thing I'm gonna d. is kick your ass into your throat. That's not Julie. - So. - It's just important to me that you know. - Can I help you. - Yeah, I'm Charlie Harper. - I need to see my doctor. - Do you have an appointment. No, but this is an emergency. He has to get back to Notre Dam. and ring the bell. Oh, I get it. He's hunched over. That's funny. Yeah, can I see my doctor, please. - Who's your doctor. - Dr. Schwartz. - Stanley Schwartz. - Yes, Stanley. - It's Stanley. - Thank you. When was the last tim. you were here. I don't know. A couple of years ago. Why. - Dr. Schwartz passed away. - Oh, no. So where's Julie. Julie we had to let go. She was playing a little fast and loos. with the old prescription pad. I'm guessing Valium. Is there somebody els. who can see him. Yeah, but not Dr. Schwartz's doctor. okay. Dr. Talmadge took ove. Dr. Schwartz's practice. It's a little tight right now. but I could squeeze you in. That's kind of how this happened. Oh, my. So this was a sexual injury. Well, thank goodness you're okay. This is really gross. Why do I have to do it. - You want your toilet seat back. - Yes. Then keep scrubbing. You know, taking it wasn't funny. I could have broke my butt. Oh, come on. How could that not be funny. Don't forget to clean on the outside. That's all you. - And the floor, and the wall. - Okay, okay. How in the hel. did you hit the wall anyway. I don't know. it just gets away from me sometimes. After a day scrubbing toilets... ...I'm betting you'll be able to pe. through a Cheerio at 10 paces. Oh, God. Oh, jeez. Hey, guess what. The Soviet Unio. is boycotting the Olympics. My pain is just a big jok. to you, isn't it. I offered to help you, Charlie. and you refused, so... ...yeah. I'll tell you, if you came to m. as a patient in this much pain... ...I wouldn't make you wait. I'd see you right away. So would my dry cleaner. but I don't let him touch me either. I could help you, Charlie. I've already isolate. the source of your discomfort. All that's left would b. to realign your vertebrae... ...through a gentle serie. of manipulations and stretches... ...thereby alleviating your pain. Well, you didn't explain it like that. That's different. - So you'll let me work on you. - Not in a million years. Fine. Worship at the alta. of the American Medical Association. Swallow the pharmaceutical companies. propaganda. I'll swallow it, I'll sniff it. I'll insert it rectally. Anything to kill the pain. I'm dying here. Mr. Harper, I'm Dr. Talmadge. Hello, doctor. Hallelujah. It's a miracle. So I see you're having some back pain. That will be $ 100, please. Yeah, it started in my back... ...but now it's kind of radiating ou. into a body-wide unbearable agony. You have a really cute little nose. you know that. - Did the pain start in your lower back. - Best I can tell... ...it's a spasm betwee. L4 and L5. - Oh, are you a doctor. - Yes, I'm a chiropractor. So no. How did this happen. Well, I slipped. On an actress. I can handle this, Alan. Okay, see, the thing is. I was in the middle of... An actress. I'm warning you. - Do the details really matter. - No, no, I think I got the picture. There's video if you need it. Keep it up. Okay, I see here your last visi. was four years ago. A mild hernia brought about by... Okay. I think I'm seein. a pattern here. He's a sexual compulsiv. with narcissistic tendencies. Oh, so you'r. a pretend psychiatrist too. So, what's the cours. of treatment here. A pill, a shot. Maybe one of those epidurals. First I'm going to ge. your blood pressure and take x-rays. - I take blood pressure and x-rays. - Your mother must be very proud. Actually, no. Someone will be i. to take you to x-ray. Wait. I'm still in pain. Try and hang in there. In the meantime... ...maybe your little budd. can give you a massage. - Can you believe her. - Yeah, she is something else. Please don't tell me you're intereste. in that condescending... ...arrogant excuse for a woman. Pardon me, Alan. but that is a condescending... ...arrogant, hot excuse for a woman. She's just your typical obnoxious MD. I'm a doctor. I have special license plates. I can park wherever I want. I know where I wanna park. You're unbelievable. Does your pen1s have an off switch. A pause button. No, just a little freckle. You're always telling me I should dat. a better class of woman. What's classier than a doctor. Oh, please. Four years of med school. two years of internship... ...a year of residency. and everybody thinks they're so special. But I'll tell you something. A new day is dawning. A day of reckoning. And it is spelled HMO. No more country clubs. No more Cadillacs. Just sky-high insurance premium. and low, slow, copay reimbursements. Just like the rest of us. I'll bet she knows a lo. of secret anatomy stuff. You know, places you touc. and the top of your head flies off. If you have s*x with a doctor. there's a chance they'll split... ...in the middle of the nigh. for an emergency. Well, that's just a pric. you'll have to pay. . . . . No, no. That works for me. Okay, I finished the toilet. the shower... ...and the sink. - What took you so long. I went to the bathroom. and I had to start over. Take these, and get starte. on the kitchen floor. Why? I didn't pee in here. Okay, once, but it was in the sink. The sink? How'd you manage that. It's not that hard. You just gott. drink a lot of root beer, lean back... ...and figure the angle. So tell me about Dr. Talmadge. - Is she seeing anybody. - Yes. - Is it serious. - Dog bite. - No, I mean... - Charlie, give it a rest. What. You're sitting here in pai. because of a casual sexual encounter... ...and now you're tryin. to drum up another one. - Yeah, so. - Don't you get it. Your entire life is about jumping... ...from one shallow. meaningless relationship to the next. And. You're a grown man. You can't go through life... ...drinking and partying and humpin. anything that doesn't shake you off. Yes, I can. But sooner or later. it's gonna catch up to you. Eventually. you will have to pay the piper. - Who says. - Everybody says. Really? Because I'm just hearing you. If 2000 years of human histor. has taught us anything... ...it's that there is karmic justic. in the world... ...and that when people liv. the way you do... ...bad things happen to the. to even things out. Well, I don't agree. It's not up for debate. It's a law, like gravity. Oh, I agree with gravity. Good, we wouldn't want yo. flying off the planet... ...with nothing to hum. but satellites. If it makes you feel better. something bad happened. - I'm in excruciating pain. - That's not enough. Trust me, Charlie. The piper has yet to be paid. The only question is how high a ta. you want before the bill comes due. Okay. I get it. Well, good. So you think I have a sho. with that doctor, or what. It's like trying to talk Shakespear. to a Hershey bar. Who's Piper. Oh, you poor, clueless bitch. Never trust a drifter with an eye patch. - Berta. - What. I'm tired. and my hands are all red and pruney. I've seen your grades. Get used to it. How do I know when I'm done. Don't worry about that, honey. I'll tell you. Oh, for God's sakes, don't kiss him. He's your brother. - I have x-rays. - Oh, good. Let me see them. Oh, golly, no. Only for a doctor. Hey, I'm a doctor. Oh, yeah? Where you parked. Alan, you gotta relax. You're harboring the kind of resentmen. that eats away at your insides... ...until you wake up one da. peeing blood and crapping into a bag. Thanks for the advice. You know the differenc. between you and me. I have a functioning liver... ...and somehow. you're gonna get laid tonight. That's ridiculous, Alan. She's an educated professional. Probably gonna have to thro. a few fancy meals at her first. Boo-hoo, you'll have to wai. a couple of weeks. Couple of weeks. Anyway, the differenc. between you and me... ...is that when life gives me lemons. I make lemonade. When you get lemons. you just bite into them... ...and suck them inside out. Okay. Let's see what we've got. No fractures, no dislocations. - Looks like just a simple muscle spasm. - Between L4 and L5. Oh, good for you. Okay, I am gonna give you a shot. which should ease the pain... ...and also allo. your muscles to relax. Have you had Demerol before. No, but I've heard nic. things about it. Okay, I'm just gonna pul. your shorts down a little. But Dr. Talmadge. I don't even know your first name. - Michelle. - Michelle. That's prettier than Stanley. - Sorry. - That's okay. It's all part of the little meet-cut. thing we got going here. So how long does it tak. before I start feeling... ...happy. Happy, happy, happy. Happy. Michelle, did you kno. I have a house on the beach. - Really? I love the beach. - Oh, good, because I have a house there. Wait outside, I need to give your brothe. a hernia exam to make sure... ...he hasn't reinjured the area. - A hernia exam. - And your boxers. - Bye-bye, boxers. I was wrong. There's no justice. I thought there was justice. but there's not. What, you think there's justice. Because there's not. Turn your head and cough. - You have very warm hands. - Again. You have very warm hands. So any chance I coul. take you out for dinner tonight. - You're hitting on me. - You started it. - You're amazing. - Well, statistically... ...I'm only slightly above average. But I make up for i. with enthusiasm and perseverance. No, what's amazin. is that you don't remember me. Well, sure I remember you. You're the pretty woman cuppin. my testicles from earlier. Back when I was in medical school. you and I went out for a couple months. You wanna loosen your grip there. Then for reasons I never understood... ...you stopped calling me. and started seeing my roommate. The grip. I always hoped I'd run into you again. Please. Just leave me one. Oh, dear God. My brother's making lemonade. I need to go to the bathroom. So go. Oh, yeah. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. - Night. - Night. So, are you gonna tell m. what happened with you and the doctor. What do you think happened. I think she shot you full of drugs... ...you dropped trou. she jumped your bones... ...and you're the luckiest b*st*r. to walk the earth. Well, for your information... ...that's exactly what happened. Not even a little justice. This is a justice-free zone. Looking for justice. Sorry, fresh out. Enjoy sucking on that lemon. Nope, not yet

showTwo-And-Half-MenjÎeEditor: Jk2writ. Do you just get up in the mornin. and figure out ways to make me crazy. Is that what you do. You plot it out. How can I make Ala. miserable today. How can I reach into his chest... ...rip out his heart, and suck it dry. - Mom or ex-wife. - Ex-wife. - Hi, Judith. - Charlie says hello. She says hi. You're evil and selfish, you know that. No, no. L... I think that i. a helpful comment. I pay you alimony and child suppor. so that you can have a nice house... ...a nice car, every weekend fre. because I've got Jake. And yet you're telling m. you need a vacation. Oh, really? Oh, really? And what exactl. is stressing you out, Judith. Is it the weekly manicure. The housekeeper. - Boob lift. - The boob lift. - That you paid for. - That I paid for. - And never got to see. - And never got to see. No, no, no. You listen to me. I think you live a damn fine lifestyle... ...that I work 60 hours a wee. to support. So if anybody needs a vacation. it's not you. It's me. All right, then. Goodbye. Judith's going to Hawaii for a week. So Jake's staying here. I'm shocked. Come on, Jake. It's time to get up for school. I can't go to school. - I'm sick. - What's wrong. I think I have acid reflex disease. Really? Acid reflex disease. Where does it hurt. My head. - Nice try. - My throat. Get up. All right, all right. I just want you to know. I'm starting my day really stressed out. Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like m. to send you to Hawaii. That would be nice. What's taking you so long. - I can't find my other shoe. - So put on a different pair. But this one's on already. Hey, what are you doing up so late. It's 7 a.m. - What am I doing up so early. - Where have you been. Searching the kingdo. for the woman who fits this shoe. Hey, that's mine. Where was it. In the driveway. Oh, yeah. Okay, let's go. - Got my lunch. - Lunch. - You're supposed to make me lunch. - Oh, crap. This isn't helping my stress level. I forget. Why are you her. in the middle of the week. - Because my mom's on vacation. - From what. Me. A word of advice: Don't date wome. who live near the airport. It's impossible to sleep in. I'll try to remember that. Wish I knew her well enoug. to bring her back here. Well, maybe next time. Next time. - My lunch ready. - It's right here. What are you doing. - That was for Jake. - I don't see his name on it. Okay, fine. You'Il... You'll have half a sandwich... ...and a banana. and maybe an orange, and... ...what the hell, an artichoke. An artichoke. Maybe you can trade i. for something good. With who? One of the slow kids. Give it a shot. Tell him it's a puppy. Come on, let's go. I forgot. I have to write five insightfu. questions I'd ask George Washington. What? Last nigh. you said you had no homework. Dad, I just said I forgot. - Okay, fine. You'll do it in the car. - I was planning on doing math in the car. President Washington. Question number one. "Have you ever thought of comin. back from the dead as a zombie?. Jake, I don't think that'. what your teacher had in mind. Do you wanna do it. No, no. You're doing fine. Question two. "Can you eat human fles. with wooden teeth?. Hi, Lorraine. I'm running a little late. Could you move my 9:30 to 10. my 10 to 10:30... ...and, well. you see where this is going. You don't. Hang on, I've got somebod. on the other line. Hello. Oh, hi, Mom. Look, I can't tal. right now. I'm driving Jake to school. Well, Judith's in Hawaii. No, that does not make m. a doormat. Patsy is just another wor. for doormat, Mom. L... Lo... I gotta go. I'll call you later. Hi, Lorraine. I'm back. No, no, don't put me on hold. Question three. "Do you think the Revolutionary Wa. would have been won sooner... ...if you had an army of the undead?. This is actually pretty easy. Lorraine, this is Dr. Harper. Listen, I'm... I'm gonna be ther. in about 40 minutes. What do you mean. you're going home. Oh, come on. You were premenstrual two weeks ago. Yes, I keep track. Question number four. "What's your opinion of the new. faster-walking zombies?. No, no, no. Lor... Lorraine. Don't cry. Please don't cry. Charlie, I'm going home. How many time. have I asked you not to do that. - I'm going home. - I suppose you want me to pay you. Not necessary. I took the money out of your wallet. - Fine. - Guess what? I got a raise. Congratulations. - You wanna know why I got a raise. - No, I'm sure I had my reasons. Because when I took this job. all I had to do was clean up after you. And while that ma. have been disgusting, it was doable. And then your brother moved in, whic. I accepted with my usual good humor... ...because he cleans up after himsel. like a neurotic raccoon. This is about the kid, right. Good for you. That's why you're the boss. He's just here for a week. It's a temporary situation. And yet my raise is permanent. Sounds fair. God, what a horrible day. - Tell me about it. - Show of hands. Who spent their da. pre-soaking the shorts of a kid... ...who leaves more skid mark. than a getaway car. That's what I thought. Now, if you ladies will excuse me... ...I have three buses to catch. I bet she catches them by hand. Yeah, well, I have my own problems. I was late for work. my receptionist went home early... ...because, apparently, she ha. the reproductive cycle of a jackrabbit... ...and then I had a large. drunk Samoan man walk in... ...who thought that chiropractor mean. "massage with happy ending.. I kept trying to crack his back an. he kept rolling over and winking at me. - Wow, that's creepy. - Tell me about it. So you're gonna see him again. Or should I say. are you gonna see him Samoa. Oh, come on. That was funny. Oh, yeah. It's hilarious. You know what your problem is. - You don't drink enough. - You're probably right. This is the first time today I've had . chance to just sit down and decompress. - Cheers. - Oh, cheers. Oh, that's good. I keep having this nagging feelin. that I forgot something. - Lf you forgot it, it wasn't important. - Yeah, I guess. I can't believe you forgot me. I said I'm sorry. You forgot me. I know. I feel terrible. How many kids you got. - There's a towel on the floor, buddy. - I'm okay. I want you to sit on it so you don't leav. a wet ass-print on my leather seats. You forgot me too. Yeah, but I'm just your uncle. He's your father. Yeah, my own father. Thanks, Charlie. Is there any wa. I can make it up to you. - You wanna go out for a special dinner. - No. - How about a movie. - Why. You're gonna leave me there too. For the last time, I am sorry. Won't be the last time. I just wanna go home. I'm cold and I'm wet. If you kick the back of my seat again. you're gonna be colder and wetter. Ease up on him. He's had a rough day. Yeah, my dad left me out in the rain. I'm sorry. What did I tell you. What's all this stuff on the floor. I don't know. Junk mail. Parking tickets. - What's this. - Satin blindfold. - For what. - What do you mean, "For what". In case I run into... ...a pi?ata. - You're unbelievable. - Don't judge. You felt up a Samoan dude. Hey, this is for me. From the IRS. It was mailed a month ago. Damn post office. Oh, perfect. - Just freaking perfect. - Good news. I'm being audited. They wanna see me tomorrow. Oh, well, look at the upside. What upside. Yeah, okay, you got me. How could you forge. to give this to me. I don't know. How could yo. forget your only son in the rain. - Yeah. - Yeah. Watch the cleats. Let's go, sleepyhead. Rise and shine, up and at 'em. Get out of my roo. or I'll kill you with my bare hands. I'm being audited today. You have to take Jake to school. Put him in a cab. Oh, please. I am counting on you. Then you're heade. for disappointment. You need to get Jake dressed. make him his lunch... ...and get him to school by 8, okay. - Okay. - You're not moving. - Yes, I am. I'm flipping you off under the covers. Get up. All right, I'm up. So you know what to do with Jake. You have to be responsible. You have to be me today. - Think you can handle that. - You left him out in the rain yesterday. It's not like you set the bar real high. - Charlie. - Relax. I think I'm capabl. of getting your kid to school. Good, because I really need your help. So... So I'm gonna leave now. You're all set, right. Charlie. Get up. . . . . Get dressed. I'm taking you to school. I can't. I'm sick. Yeah, well, bite me. - Hey. - Don't... Don't screw with me, shorty. I only got, like. nine hours of sleep last night. - Now get dressed. - I'm supposed to take a shower first. Sit near a window. - Here, put these on. - I wore these yesterday. They're still extremely stylish. Put them on. - Can I have some privacy, please. - For what? You're 11. That's close to puberty. Okay, okay. I'm leaving. What am I, nuts. Get up. I could have dressed myself. you know. You had your chance. I look stupid. Yeah, well, you're close to puberty. Oh, I forgot to comb my hair. No, no, no. I'll do it. That's spit. Hey, one man's saliva is anothe. man's mousse. Now shut up. There, you're beautiful. Let's go. - What about lunch. - Sorry, I have plans. No, you're supposed t. make me lunch. Oh, all right, come on. You're not really a morning person. are you. You're just saying tha. because I spit on your head. - You like cold pizza, right. - Sure. - This is frozen. - Yeah. If you sit on it... ...it'll thaw by lunch. My butt is freezing. You wanted pizza. All right, I'll put the seat warmer on. Cook it from both sides. - I like it better when my dad takes me. - Oh, gee, you're not having fun. Because I'm farting rainbow. over here. First, he forgets me. Now he leaves me with you. Hey, you know what. Your father works like a do. to make sure you have everything. If he's not there for you... ...it's just because he's tryin. to stay out of federal prison. I think he needs to have s*x. I was kidding about prison, Jake. What do you mea. he needs to have s*x. Well, he's been really grumpy lately. You're usually in a good mood. I figure it's because you have s*x. Jake, it takes more than s*. to make a man happy. You also need money. All right, have a good day. - Learn something. - This isn't my school. - What do you mean. - I mean, I don't go to school here. Well, where do you go to school. Woodward Avenue Elementary. - And where the hell is that. - Woodward Avenue, I guess. I don't know why you can'. tough it out here for one day. Make some new friends. Hey, Alan, it's Charlie. Look, I wanna ask you something but . don't want you to read anything into it. Where exactly is Jake's school. You don 't know where his school is. What the hell is wrong with you. - Are you trying to kill me. - You could be right about the s*x thing. Okay, Woodward Avenu. Elementary School. Looks like they're closed. That's because I'm an hour late. Even the crossing guard is gone. How about this? Why don't you jus. bag school and we'll go catch a movie. - I can't skip school. I'm in the play. - What play. The founding fathers' play. You'll be there, right. Why would I be there. Because Mom's in Hawaii and Dad's go. that tax thing and you're all that's left. Oh, I'm all that's left. Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either. Okay. Where and when. In the auditorium after lunch. Oh, yeah. I nee. a Ben Franklin costume. You're telling me this now. I told Mom but she's in Hawaii. All right. Let's see. Washington, Jackson, Lincoln. Here we go. Benjamin Franklin. Why can't you be Lincoln. A beard, a mole, a top hat. we're done. Because Lincol. wasn't a founding father. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Now get out of here. Hey. You forgot your lunch. Hey. God, what a day. I don't wanna hear it. You know why I was being audited. Not because I have unsubstantiate. deductions. Which I have. Not because I take the occasiona. cash payment from a client... ...and forget to report it. Which I do. It was because no one at the IRS... ...could believe I was payin. as much alimony as I claimed. It took me three hour. to convince them that, yes... ...I am that big a schmuck. Oh, boo-hoo. You want a real fun time. Try finding an extra smal. Ben Franklin costume... ...at 9:00 in the morning. Oh, right. The play. How was it. Boffo. A smash. Among the highlights were a 12-year-ol. Chinese George Washington... ...with a powdered wi. and a snot bubble... ...and your kid in a bald ca. and granny glasses... ...holding a Tweety Bird kite an. announcing he's discovered elasticity. - Oh, I wish I'd seen it. - Don't worry, you will. It was videotape. from about 150 different angles. I should tell hi. I'm sorry I wasn't there. - Yeah, you should. - Is he in his room. Here you go, pal. Your favorite. Bacon double cheeseburge. and cheese fries. And for dessert, I got fudge brownie. with that ice cream you like. Is this supposed t. make up for everything. - Yeah. - Pretty much. Look, Jake, I know it's been roug. and I'm sorry. We're human, we make mistakes. But I promise you... ...neither of us will ever. ever forget to pick you up again. Yeah, I still wanna go back to Mom's. When is she coming hom. from Hawaii, anyway. Oh, crap

episode=;Episode-13-ZejdÅº z Moich WÅosÃ³w (a.k.a. Get Off My Hair)j`Editor: Jk2writ. Crap. Oopsie. Oh, Charlie. Okay, I guess I'll give you a call. Alrighty, that'd be great. Sounds good. Looking forward to it. Bye-bye now. Swell. Hey, Alan. You know how to say. "Please go faster," in Polish. - Funny language, isn't it. - Yeah, hilarious. The earthquake hit Sherman Oak. a lot harder than Malibu. - What earthquake. - What earthquake. About an hour ago. You didn't feel the house shaking. Unbelievable. You actually thought that was you. No, I thought it was her. you know, because of me. The good news is. unless they report it on Polish TV... ...I still get the credit. I'm thrilled for you. Anyway, Judith called. A pipe broke. soaked her living room carpet... ...and she's completely freaking out. Yeah, well, that's the differenc. between wife and ex-wife. With ex-wife, you don't even have t. pretend to care. Well, I'm sorry. I can't be that callous. Have you even tried. She's the mother of my son. I'm concerned about her welfare. I told her she could stay her. until repairs. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up. Back up. When you told her, did you have, like. a sarcastic chuckle in your voice. Like, you know, " Yeah, right, Judith. you can stay here.. - It's just for a couple of days. - A couple of days. Jack The Ripper just kille. a couple of prostitutes. It was still wrong. - Do you want me to put her in a hotel. - Yeah, put her in a hotel. Put her in a space capsule. Put he. in a catapult and see how far she flies. Charlie, I can't do that to her. Again, have you even tried. - She's afraid of another quake. - Well, what about what I'm afraid of. - What are you afraid of. - Oh, let's see. Large birds. Small bugs. Unplanned pregnancies. And your ex-wife living in my house. Come on, Charlie. She's just a small, frightened woman. There are no small, frightened women. That's a myth. Perpetrated by the large, angr. women who secretly run the world. I think it would be healthy for Jak. to see his mother and father... ...living together as friends. Oh, Alan, grow up. As long as he's got pizza with chees. and TV with 150 channels... ...he doesn't give a rat's as. what you guys do. Now that I think about it, neither do I. That had better be a big. pregnant bird covered with spiders. - I don't know how to thank you. - I'm glad you're okay. Charlie, I know this is a big imposition. I really appreciate you inviting me. I thought she should kno. this was your idea. Actually, I had several other ideas. Wanna hear them. Tell Jake you're here. I'll take your bags. Thank you, Alan. Thank you both. I promise I'll be out of her. in a couple of days. - Judith, sit down. I've got it covered. - No. I can pitch in. Where do you keep the salad tongs. Wait, I got them. - Better use the wooden ones. - What's wrong with these. I use those whenever I drop my watc. in the toilet. This is a regular occurrence. - You'd think I'd learn. - And you keep them in the kitchen. I used to hang them in the bathroom. but it freaked some chicks out. He's just kidding with you. Use the wooden ones. I don't want any salad. - Well, you have to have some. - Dad doesn't make me have salad. Alan. He's exaggerating. We have salad all the time. I just don't eat it. It's kind of our compromise. Okay. Fine. Your house, your rules. Technically, it's my house, his rules. Of course. Just have a little salad. So I spoke wit. the plumbing company... ...and they'll be there in the morning. So I'll drop off Jak. and meet them on my way to work. - Thank you, Alan. - You're welcome. This is really weird. Why? Your mom and I may not be livin. together anymore, but we're still friends. I don't flip off my friend. when I talk to them on the phone. Nice shooting. Two with one bullet. Well, if either of us did. in fact, do that, it was wrong. The important thing is we're makin. an effort to be nicer to each other. That's right. And your mom staying her. is a good example of that. Very nicely put, Alan. If we leave now. we can be in Mexico in two hours. Hey. Hey. - Where's Alan. - Don't know. Mind if I join you. Sure. Thanks again for your hospitality. Don't mention it. You know, the TV in your room works. Oh, okay. Good to know. I just tucked Jake in. He loves you very much. Yeah. I love him too. You got cable, satellite, DVD. The whole shebang. Great. I'm surprised you're hom. on a Saturday night. What, with your fun bachelor lifestyle. Well, I got laid this morning. So I thought I'd kick back tonight. Oh, my. Well, isn't that something. - Nice girl. - I guess. She doesn't speak English. Well, hey. What are you guys doing. Just watching a little TV. - What's on. - I don't know. I just sat down. Oh, we've seen this movie before. - No, we didn't. - Sure we have. That guy's girlfrien. turns out to be the murderer. Really? I did not know that. Oh, right. And she's not really a girl. I did not know that either. - When did we see this. - The first movie after Jake was born. Oh, right. It was so hard to leave hi. with the sitter. As soon as we got to the door. the sobbing started. Yeah, well, it was hard for me. You were such a softy. Alcohol. While you're up. you wanna make popcorn. - Sure. - No butter for me. Got it. - Hey, Charlie. - Hey, Rose. Anybody here. Good. Jeez. - I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep. - That's all right. Relax. - You sure. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine. - Where's Alan. - He took Jake to school... ...then went to meet with the plumber. - Right, right. Okay, I'll leave you to it. Charlie, wait. This is your home. Sit down. Drink your coffee. Okay. Oh, and I'm white trash. What are you, a farm animal. - What. - That's your brother's ex-wife out there. I know who she is. Oh, no, no. She's just staying her. because of the earthquake. I'm not. I would never. I couldn't. Okay, I could. But I'm not. Yeah. That's what I used to sta. about my stepbrother, Cousin Dewey. How's it going. Used to having your mom here. Nope. You. I'm still thinking Mexico. I liked it bette. when they weren't talking. Can't get away with muc. when they compare notes. It's hell. Jake, your mom wants to sa. goodbye. - She's leaving. - Just for a little while. - Where's she going. - Just out to dinner. You know, with a friend. I guess it's a date of some sort. She's going on a date. Of some sort. - And you're okay with this. - Oh, yeah. We talked about it. I think it's a sig. of maturity that our relationship... ...has evolved enough that we can b. honest that we see other people. Yeah, except the people you're seein. are in magazines and videos. Hey, I told yo. to stay out of my room. And that's not the point. If I were dating... ...she'd be just as supportiv. of me as I am of her. We're no longer ex-husband and ex-wife. We are friends getting on with our lives. She's happy and I'm happy. - Okay. I'm leaving. - Oh, have fun. Wow, I'm impressed. What happened to my jealous. tightly-wrapped, neurotic brother. Oh, there he is. Well, well, well. - Alan. - Oh, you remember me. What are you doing up so late. That's funny, I was abou. to ask you the same thing. Don't tell me you wer. waiting up for me. This isn't abou. what I was doing, Judith. No, no. This is abou. what you were doing until... ...now. I told you I had a date. You said you were fine with it. In theory, I was. In practice. I think we can both see I'm not. What did you want me to do. sit here and do nothing. Why not. It was good enough for me. You know what. you haven't changed at all. You're still the same neurotic. overbearing, control freak I threw out. Neurotic? Maybe. Overbearing? Perhaps. But you know what. You're not gonna throw me out. because I have changed. Tonight, I'm leaving you. As it turns out. a distinction without a difference. . . . . Fine, Alan. Suit yourself. Where's Dad. - He's at our house. - How come. Well, we decided we neede. a little time apart. Isn't that why you got a divorce. It's hard to explain, Jake. - Do I get any presents this time. - No. What happens now. You gonna live here. - No. - Are you gonna buy a new house. No. Wanna go to Mexic. with me and Uncle Charlie. - Good morning. - Good morning. Where's Alan. - Well, it's a long story. - You're not gonna believe it. Hi. I just stopped b. to say I told you so. I told you so. Oh, come on, Alan. If you can'. laugh at yourself, at least let me do it. What do you want, Charlie. Well... ...first of all, I'd like to kno. exactly how you managed... ...to let your ex-wif. throw you out of my house. Because that's the first thing peopl. are gonna ask when I tell this story. She didn't throw me out, I left. Oh, good, there's a twist. You see. that's what makes a good story. - Leave me alone, Charlie. - Oh, lighten up. You tried to be friends with the woma. who wrecked your life and failed. No damage done. Just a little personal humiliation... ...and at this point in your life. how would you even notice that. - Are you finished. - Did I mention I told you so. - Twice. - Counting this one. - Okay, I'm finished. - Thank you. Now, on to new business. Currently, you and I are sitting in . house that belongs to neither one of us. While your ex-wife is sittin. in the house that belongs to me. - You see the paradox. - I can't go back there, Charlie. She's running around, havin. a great time, and I've got nothing. - You've got me. - Drop dead. Okay, now you got nothing. It would be differen. if Judith and I were both dating. True, but moot. - Unless... - What unless. - It's stupid. - Stupider than this. Come on. What do you got. Well, what if you were dating. - But I'm not. - But if you looked like you were. Oh, you mean? No, no way. I'm not gonna let you fix me u. with one of your bimbo girlfriends. Okay, forget it. She'd have to be really pretty. Like a 10. And young. Like a 20. - Anything else. - And smart. And a sense of humor is important. Well-read, good with kids... ...non-smoking, of course. Oh, and easy on the piercings. Nothing south of the equator. You're mighty picky for a guy wit. an adult newsstand in his sock drawer. Okay. Homework is taken care of. He's taking a shower. You may wanna check in on him. make sure he's not goofing around. - Where are you going. - Oh, I have dinner plans. - Really. - Yeah. Hard to believe, huh. - I didn't say that, I'm happy for you. - Well, thank you. Again, I'm sorry I overreacte. the other night. I want us to have the kind of friendshi. that can be mutually supportive. - Me too. - You'll go out, I'll go out. Right. So is this someon. you've been seeing for a while. Yeah, a while. But, you know, not exclusive. I don't wanna get tied down. Oh, that must be Camille. - She picks you up. - Well, what can I say. It's a new world, Judith. Hey, wow. You are so good for my ego. - Hi, Charlie. - Hi, Camille. - Hello, I'm Judith. - You're Alan's ex. Wow, I didn't expec. you to be so young looking. - Thank you. - I mean, you have such beautiful skin... ...for the mother of an 11 -year-old. Oh, thank you. Okay. Well, we should get going. It was nice meeting you. I just hope I look half as good as he. when I'm that old. I'm betting you will. Man, I don't know how he does it. I made a big play for her, nothing. - She's so young. - Yeah, some guys like that. I gotta hand it to you, Judith. You were very mature. I guess that's becaus. you're a very mature woman. Yeah, thanks. Jake, say goodbye to Mommy. She's going home. - Good morning, everybody. - Good morning. Sounds like somebody cracked ope. the sock drawer last night. I'm going to ignore that because I a. in such a good mood. Charlie, thank you. Your ex-wife breaking the sound barrie. on her way out was thanks enough. I don't even care about that anymore. That was the best date of my life. I mean, Camille is smart and funny. And, oh, boy, talk about pretty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet sh. rocked your world in the sack, huh. What? No, no. Get your mind ou. of the gutter. We just talked all night... ...and then there was a little kissing. Maybe on our next date, who knows. But for now. I'm just gonna play it slow. - You're playing it slow. - Yeah. I don't know where you found Camille. but she's a bit old-fashioned. She's not like the one. you usually go out with. No, I guess not. A thousand dollars a nigh. and he's playing it slow. You're a good brother, Charlie. He's playing it slow. She demanded cash. He's playing it slow

showTwo-And-Half-Menjê]Editor: Jk2writ. Jake, use your spoon. Can't. I'll die. If you don't turn off that music. you'll die anyway. Fine. That's better. He's still gonna be living her. when he's, like, 30. My big fear is he'll still b. in fifth grade. Hello, anybody home. Grandmommy's here. There's my grandson. So, Mom, to what do we ow. this unexpected... - Pleasure. - No, that's not it. I was showing a house, an. I thought I'd visit the people I love. And they weren't home. Goody. There's a Tudor on Stone Canyo. that's going on the market soon. - How do you know. - Owner dropped dead of a heart attack. You know what they say, darling. Today's obituar. is tomorrow's exclusive listing. Father of five in Westwood. I'm on fire. You will be soon. Mom, you're not settin. a very good example here. Why. Jake, honey, your grandmommy perform. a very important public service. When people die. their families are very, very sad... ...and they have no ide. what their homes are worth. And you tell them. Oh, you are so cute. And Grandmommy doesn't jus. prey on the dead, Jake. She also profits from the pain of divorc. and the humiliation of bankruptcy. Not to mention she's working on a. alternative fuel made from puppies. Oh, my God. Harry Gorsky died. Oh, no. Are you sure it's him. How many Harry Luther Gorsky. are there in Los Angeles. - Well, there's one less now. - Who are you talking about. He was Uncle Charlie'. and my stepdad. - The first of three, and not my favorite. - I liked him. Oh, please. You were 6. You still liked Mom. - Mom, are you okay. - No, I'm not okay. He was a good man... ...and part of my life. and now he's gone. I just pray he died peacefully... ...and held on to that statel. six-bedroom, four-bath Colonial... ...in Hancock Park... ...with the bonus office/guest roo. over the garage. Let me get this straight. First there was your dad. then this guy Harry who died... ...then the fat gu. with the carpet business. No, no, no. The fat guy came afte. the twitchy gay guy from Texas... ...who gave us crew cut. and called us buckaroos. So out of the three... ...Harry was the best. - I liked the fat guy, remember. With the chubby daughte. who was so grateful. All you had to do was knock on her doo. with some Turkish Taffy. Be that as it may. he was still a very good father to us. Oh, please. He was a little tyrant. "Sit up straight.. "Do your homework.. "Quit forging my signatur. on hotel bills.. Okay, then. The funeral is tomorrow. I think it would be appropriate for us al. to go and pay our respects. I don't know. Tomorrow's not good for me. Oh, Charlie. The man was your father. No, he was not. Why do you care so much. You divorced him. Just because you divorce doesn't mea. you no longer have feelings. That's true. Judith still has feelings for me. Pity is not really a feeling, Alan. Regardless of our feelings, we'll still g. and say our final goodbyes to Harry. - I'm not going. - Me neither. - Fine, you stay here with Uncle Charlie. - Cool. Yeah, cool. Why do you wanna go. I think it's the right thing to do. and I liked Harry. - And he liked you. - I know. We've stayed in touch over the years. What. You betrayed me by communicating wit. that son of a bitch after I divorced him. Well, wait a minute. You said that... I know what I said. I was just being polite becaus. the guy's worm chow. All I did was send him Christmas card. and a picture of Jake. - You never send me a picture of Jake. - He's right here. When was the last tim. I got a Christmas card. Wait, I'm on your side. Charlie's the one who doesn't wanna go. I don't even know if I wan. you to come now. You've ruined it. - How can you ruin a funeral. - I don't wanna talk about it anymore. - Where are you going. - I need something black. Doesn't your soul qualify. Laugh now, but when I die. I will be coming back to haunt you. How will that be any differen. than this. Okay, Jake. I'm going to pick up your grandmother. Okay. You think mayb. you've played that enough. Okay. I might as well just buy hi. a crack pipe. Hey. - Let's get this over with. - You're coming to the funeral. I thought about it and realized. even if I didn't like the guy... ...that shouldn't stop me fro. going to his funeral... ...and, you know, taking a victory lap. Charlie, you're no. gonna wanna hear this... ...but you sound a lot like Mom. Tread lightly. - Jake, you're coming with us. - I don't wanna. You get to see a real dead guy. There's gonna be a dead guy? Where. - At the funeral. - Oh, cool. Can I come. Did I say he was gonn. live here until 30. I meant forever. What are you talking about. - Go put on your nice clothes. - Okay. He doesn't kno. what nice clothes are. - Jake. - Oh, right. Isn't it a little early to start drinking. - Would you like a snort. - That's what I meant. Thanks. You okay, Mom. I just can't believe he's gone. Isn't that why we're goin. to the funeral? To make sure. I'm confused. If you cared for Harr. so much, how come you left him. Yes, well, about that. I may have glossed over the detail. with you boys just a skosh. I didn't actually leave Harr. so much as he left me. - You're kidding. - He met a younger woman... ...and just traded me in. You still loved him, didn't you. I loved him very much. Oh, Harry. My sweet, dear Harry. All right. Level eight. So where's the dead guy. Jake, show a little respect. Where's the dead guy, sir. In the chapel. Now keep it down. I think I can smell him. Oh, Lord. There she is. - Who. - The tramp who stole my husband. Not bad. Not good. I'm gonna go mourn. - Yeah, me too. - Stay put. Mommy needs you. - Hello, Evelyn. - Hello, Christine. - This is my son, Alan. - Hello. And who's this little guy. Your grandson. I'm just here to see the dead guy. Yes, I've been blessed wit. both children and grandchildren. How about you? Oh, wait, I remember. You were slightly less fertil. than a sand trap. We're very sorry for your loss. It's not my loss. He left me for that tramp over there. She doesn't look very unhappy. does she. She just met him. Wait a week. I think it's the responsibility of we. the living, to carry on... ...to live life to the fullest. Embrace it. Kiss it on the mouth, if you will. Excuse me, Charlie. can I talk to you for a minute. Sure. Heather. this is my brother, Alan. He lives with m. at my beach house in Malibu. - Hi. - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - Alan came to live with me... ...at my Malibu beach hous. when he lost his wife. It's a healing house. My wife isn't really dead. Because you healed. At my Malibu beach house. And when you think about it. Harry isn't really dead either. He lives right here... ...in all of us. - Thank you. - Good. Let go. It's good to let go. Charlie. Excuse me a moment. What, what, what, what, what. What do you mean. "What, what, what". - You're hitting on the widow. - No, I'm consoling the widow. I won't hit on he. until they close the lid. Unbelievable. How do you sleep at night. Usually drunk and on top of somebody. But that takes work, Alan. Doesn't just happen by itself. Here's an idea. Why don't you ru. to the embalming room... ...and see if you can score a coupl. fresh ones off the truck. Excuse me. but considering your ex-wife... ...I'd say you're the expert on having s*. with cold women who don't move. Nevertheless, you ca. hit on women anywhere. Why did you bother to come. I don't know. I just did. - That's it? No reason. - Do you have a reason for everything. - Yes. - So how's that working out for you. I know how difficult it must be... ...rambling around all by yourself in tha. big, drafty, six-bedroom Colonial... . . . . ...with the guest room/offic. over the garage. Harry gave me a potbellied pig. So you'd remember him, sure. But I know Harry would want yo. to move on... ...and this is the perfect tim. to move on... ...because this is a seller's market. - Excuse me. Can we talk to you a minute. Pardon me, dear. What? I'm working here. That woman just lost her husband. Alan, the man was 50 years ol. when she was born. - So. - So she had to see it coming. Even for you, that is really cold. Oh, Mr. Graveside Nookie weighs in. You were trying to give the wido. a sympathetic crotch to cry on. Hey, watch your mouth. This is a solemn event. Yeah, show a little class. Me? I'm the only one her. behaving appropriately. Hey, where's Jake. - Jake. - How do you know my name. - It's okay. - Okay. I almost pooped my pants. What are you doing. I just wanted to see. Okay, well, let's... Let's take a look. - Really. - Yeah. Come on. - What do you think. - I don't know. - How did he die. - He just got old. His heart stopped. His watch is still going. - Yep. - Why would he need a watch, anyway. It's not like he's gonna b. late for anything. Okay, there are other people waitin. to pay their respects. Why don't we go find Grandma. I don't care what anybody says. I always thought you were a good guy. Thanks, Alan. Want to know what time it is. Let's go. - How's he look. - Dead. Cool. Surprise. Listen, I just wanted to tell yo. that I've been thinking about it... ...and maybe some of the stuf. between us may have been my fault. I was angry about losing my dad. and I guess... ...you were the guy I took it out on. Anyway, not that it make. a lot of difference at this point... ...but I just wanted you to kno. that I'm sorry. By the way, I'm gonna take a sho. at your wife. But that's just a guy thing. Nothing personal, okay. I'll take that as a yes. And so with every door that God closes. he opens a window. Did he say "window" or "widow". Even as we say goodby. to our beloved friend... ...Harry Luther Gorsky... ...we know that he lives o. in all of us. - How are you holding up. - Okay. - Lf you need anything, I'm right here. - Thank you. That's very comforting. For everything, there is a season. A time to be born, a time to die. A time to reap, a time to sow. So... ...I would like to invite anyone... ...who wishes to say a few word. about Harry... ...to come up and share with us. As always, I'll do him first. - Mom, bad idea. - Hey... ...if I didn't give in to bad ideas. you wouldn't be here. Hold this. Dad. I can't find my Gameboy. Not now, Jake. Hello. Welcome to Harry's funeral. I haven't seen him so draine. of bodily fluids since our honeymoon. What? I thought I'd open with a joke. My name is Evelyn Harper... ...or, as dear Harry used to call me. his sweet little sugar tushy. When I first met Harry... ...I was just a hot young wido. with bills to pay... ...who could lick the chrom. off a trailer hitch. I also had two small boys... ...one of whom Harry cared fo. very deeply. The other one was Charlie. It wasn't easy bein. a substitute father... ...but Harry gave it his all. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough... ...which is probably wh. he looked for solace... ...in the arms of a cheap slut. Stand up, Christine. Let everybody have a look at you. Take a good look, Heather. That's gonna be you someday. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being disrespectfu. to the grieving widow. But, listen, you wanna talk grieving. I'm grieving. I loved this man with all my heart. and you left me, you lousy b*st*rd. Well, take a good look. I've still got a great ass... ...and yours is decomposin. as we speak. Thank you. - Okay. That was beautiful. - Time to go. I'll call you. - Dad, what about my Gameboy. - Forget it. Just keep walking. And so let's take a momen. of silent prayer for our friend, Harry. I am really, really sorry. Got it. It's my kid's. I don't know. maybe I spoil him. Okay, bye. Boys, when I die... ...I want a simple funeral. No tears. - Done. - You got it. And I wanna be burie. next to your father. Dad was cremated, Mom. Oh, yes, right. I was thinking of someone else. So I take it you'd rather b. buried than cremated. Oh, can't we do both. I want to be burie. on the side of a hill... ...nestled amongst the willows. overlooking the ocean. Do we get to pick the ocean. And I want an unadorned headstone. which reads simply. "Evelyn Harper. Loving wife, devoted mother.. That's good. Open with a joke

showTwo-And-Half-MenjïkEditor: Jk2writ. Can't we just go home. If I gotta drag you to the docto. at 8 in the morning... ...you can cool your jet. while I get coffee. I must look like an idiot. Wish I could tell you different. You're the reason we wen. to the eye doctor in the first place. You said. "Throw me a piece of toast.. I threw you a piece of toast. Two cups of regular coffee, please. - My treat. - Oh, that makes up for everything. Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket. but I get a free cup of coffee. Just the coffee. Keep the change. I'm gonna need your hel. until I get this patch off. I am absolutely there for you. Great. Great. So... So you'll drive me to work. pick me up, get Jake at school... ...do the grocery shopping... - Okay, I may have misspoken. Charlie, you have to. You know I can't drive. I don't see why not. - Oh, look who's here. - Who. A girl I used to go out with. Over there. Hey, Sherri. - Hey, Charlie, long time. - Yeah. Good to see you. - This is my brother, Alan. - Hi. - Hi. - What happened to your eye. Well, I wante. a piece of toast, and... Bar fight. - Nice to meet you. - Well, nice meeting you too. - Good to see you, Charlie. - Good to see you too. - Wow, you went out with her. - Yep. Why would you stop. I don't remember. I probably got bored. Bored? How do yo. get bored with that. For every beautiful woman. there's at least one guy out there... ...who's tired of pretending to liste. to her in exchange for s*x. Well, let me go on record as saying. I am not that guy. If I ever had a woman like that. I would cherish her. I would worship her. I would... ...start a small country and put he. face on a stamp so I could lick her head. - Why don't you go talk to her. - Yeah, right. Gorgeous women like that ar. not interested in pasty guys like me... ...unless we're in lin. for the British throne. - So you give up without even trying. - Yep. That's my motto. Why waste time on 10s when you'r. already getting rejected by sixes. Alan, listen to me. You are a smart. sensitive, good-Iooking man... ...with some milky discharg. coming out of one eye... ...but who amongst us is perfect. That's the other thing. Look at me. I'm a mess. So? Women like Sherri have big. hunky guys hitting on them all day long. A guy like you walks up, makes a move. you know what that says to her. Trick or treat. It says, "I'm confident in who I am.. - You think. - I know. So, what if she's not interested. What's the worst that could happen. Actually, the worst that could happe. is she points at me... ...and laughs, causing ever. seventh grader in the cafeteria to turn... ...and watch me slink bac. to the geek table... ...with a growing wet spo. on the front of my chinos. We ninth graders enjoyed it also. But you're not in junior high anymore. and you're not a... You're not in junior high anymore. - It's time to let go of those fears. - I don't know. Oh, come on, Alan. For once in your life, don't settle. Go for what you really want. You know what? You're right. I'm gonna go talk to her. Hold on. Let's clean some of that discharge. You wanna say "I'm confident,. not "I'm infectious.. There. Go get her. Hey, you see that guy over there. Twenty bucks says he wets himself. - Hello. - Hi. - Alan. - I remember. Look, I needed to come clea. about something. I wasn't actually in a bar fight. I took a piece of whole-wheat toas. to the eye. I mean, it was cut diagonall. and toasted well... ...so it was essentially shrapnel. Did some real damage. I see. And why do you feel the nee. to tell me all this. Well, I guess I didn't wan. our relationship to start on a lie. Our relationship. - I'll go now. - No, no, wait. Sit down. Join me. Okay. - That's it. I'm out. - Oh, come on. No, no, no. No more. You got a date. Leave it alone. Not just a date. A date with... Enough. - I'd think you'd be happy for me. - I am happy for you. You had the courage to walk over... ...with your pus-filled ey. and fall on your ass... ...and still got a date with one o. the most beautiful women I've ever met. - I'm not only happy for you, I'm proud. - Thank you. Now, I have to re-evaluat. everything I thought I knew... ...about men, women, relationships. God and the universe. But that's not your problem. Charlie, I am as surprised as yo. that she said yes. I don't think so. I was really intimidated, but as it turn. out, she's just like a regular person... ...except for, you know. being from the planet. Alan, never do that around me again. You know, actually. we have a lot in common. Okay. I'll bite. Well, we both went throug. tough divorces. - Sherri was married. - You didn't know that. - It never came up. - What did come up. Never mind. Scratch that. Where shoul. I take her to dinner. Where did you g. so I can take her somewhere else. Last thing you want is for he. to start comparing you to me. Exactly. Wait. What do you mean. You want your relationshi. to stand on its own. - Right. - Well, that's what I meant. Okay. I thought you were trying to ru. my nose in the fact that you dated her. Alan, I would never do that. Well, thank you. I don't have to. You think you could kill a gu. with a piece of toast. No. Because if you did. you could eat the toast. The police would never find th. weapon. It's the perfect crime. And part of a nutritious breakfast. Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later. Where you going. - Out for dinner. - With who. Jake, look, I think... I think you're old enough to kno. that your dad's not just a dad. He's also a man and that... ...even though I'm not marrie. to your mom... ...I still enjoy the company of women... ...which means that I wil. occasionally go out with one. But the important thin. for you to understand... ...is that I am not trying t. replace your mother. In fact, no on. can replace your mother. I bet you could kill a gu. with a piece of bacon. All right, then. I'm glad we had this talk. I'm gonna go post my pla. on the Internet. You know, there's moment. around here... ...that make me wis. I had a son of my own. That wasn't one of them. Yeah, well. Anyway, I reall. appreciate you watching him tonight. No problem. - How you getting to the restaurant. - Sherri's picking me up. - Very convenient. - Why. Because she's been here before. Been here with you. Because you've had s*x with he. in every room in the house. No, because you can't drive. But it's interesting to se. how your mind works. Alan, let me give you some advice. Alcohol impairs your abilit. to make good decisions. We don't want you to lose that ability. We want her to. Of course. Very good. What else. Well, women like Sherri already kno. they're beautiful and desirable. - You won't score points by telling her. - Okay. Don't be in a hurr. to spill your guts. She doesn't need your life story... ...before you get the salad. - Got it. As someone who knows your life story. I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all. Right, right. I'll be cool, aloof, distant. She's here, she's here, she's here. What about the... What... What... What about the kiss goodnight. - Should I ask or just go for it. - Go for it. Don't wait until the last minute. It creates pressure. - Get it out of the way early. - How early. After dinner. when you walk to the car... ...open her door, wait for he. to say thank you... ...smile, lean in, and kiss her. Oh, nice. Hi, Alan. You ready. You're the most beautiful woma. I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you. That's another way to go. - Madam. - Thank you. - Sir. - Oh, thank you. - Would you like the wine list. - No. I'll have the Woodbridge Pinot Noir. Or should we get a bottle. Oh, definitely get a bottle. Coffee for me. You know, Sherri, I'd really lik. to see more of you. Maybe we should wai. and see how tonight goes. No, I mean, I've only got one good eye. Could we change places. Oh, sure. - Are you okay. - Oh, yes, yes. Fine. - This is a nice place. - Yeah. It's my favorite. You ever come here with Charlie. I don't know. Probably. He's a big steak-eater. I'm more of a fish guy. You know, I'm surf, he's turf. And we're cops. - You're very cute. - You too. All right. So tell me about yourself. Well, there's not a lot to tell. I was San Fernando Valle. Chiropractor of the Year... ...if you follow that kind of thing. Recently divorced. But not too recently. I've already ha. my rebound, transitional relationships. - So no worries there. - Good to know. Actually, it wasn't so muc. a relationship... ...as a case of mistaken identity. but I think it still counts. - Okay. - And... ...as you know, I live with Charlie... ...whom you've already... . . . . - Met. - Yeah, let's go with met. Alan, is my having dated Charli. gonna be a problem for you. No, no, no. A little. Okay, look. Charlie and l... We had a very brief. superficial relationship. Okay? And to be honest. it was mostly about s*x. Great. My point is, yeah, I'm tired of those. those shallow relationships... ...I was having with guys like Charlie. I wanna be with a man who can b. sensitive and caring, nurturing. You know, somebody who ca. make me laugh, make me think. You do realize I'm straight, right. - See, you really are adorable. - Thank you. I tend to bring ou. the mothering instinct in women. - Oh, really. - Ironically, not my mother. What the hell are you doing. Check it out. Ninja death toast. Okay, stop it, stop it. You're in no positio. to give orders, Mr. Harper. - Morning. - Morning. - Death toast. - Oh, thank you. - So how did it go last night. - Fine. That's it? Fine. Charlie, we're not in high schoo. anymore. I'm not gonna go into detail. - Okay, don't tell me. - Jake, go watch TV. - I'm still hungry. - There's bread all over the living room. All right. - Well. - It went great. She said I'm adorable. She thinks I'. nurturing, caring and sensitive. - I'm exactly what she's looking for. - She's looking for a half-blind sheepdog. She invited me to her hous. for dinner tonight. - I think she wants to have s*x. - With who. - With me. - With you. Hang on a second. Nope. No snowballs reported in hell. No sightings of flying pigs. - What am I gonna do. - You don't know. Come on, Alan. you were married for 12 years. What does marriag. have to do with s*x. Point taken. Okay, you want some tips. No, no, nothing like that. I need step-by-step instructions. All right. Since this is you. first bout in this weight class... ...I'd say stick with the basics. Better to do the simple stuff wel. than the fancy stuff badly. Got it. And the simple stuff would be... Well, you know how wome. like you to go slow. Really? My ex-wife pu. a premium on brevity. Her motto was, " Less is more. and none is perfect.. Well, Sherri's not like that. You're gonna wanna take your time. - I can do that. - But don't loiter either. You don't want her to get bore. and play solitaire on your head. No loitering. Got it. - Something else. - Okay. When you're with a woman like Sherri. who's so gosh-darn beautiful... ...that you get excite. just thinking about her... ...how do you keep the sprinklers fro. going off while you're still mowing. Let me make sure I understand. You wanna keep your toothpast. in the tube until you're done brushing. What are you talking about. - What are you talking about. - Okay, okay. Let me try again. I don't wanna frost the cak. while I'm still mixing the batter. I don't get it. She must have lost a bet. - Excuse me. - Nothing. All right. Here's what you do. When you feel like the trai. is leaving the station... You mean, going in the tunnel. No, no, I mean leaving the station. But you have to leave the statio. to get to the tunnel. Okay, okay. Let's start from the top. And work our way down, right. You know what. Just shut up and listen. When you're making love. the way to slow yourself down is... ...to think of somethin. completely non-sexual. - Well, what do you think of. - You. That was a really great dinner. I'm glad you enjoyed it. You ready for dessert. I've been ready since I was 14. I'll be back. Why don't you put some music on. Okay. Hey, how about Diana Krall. Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD. Do you mind bringing it back to him. Not at all. I think I have one of his T-shirts. You might as well take that too. No problem. Hey, this is a cool, little CD player. Oh, thanks. It was a gift from your... It was a gift. Perfect. Is there anything els. Charlie left behind. Just me. My brother's a fool. No argument here. - That is a very effective neglig?e. - Thank you. - Was it a gift. - No. - As a matter of fact, I bought it myself. - Oh, good. - How long ago. - What. Well, I was just wonderin. if Charlie saw it. Alan, don't go there. Oh, I wasn't going anywhere. It's just that... - Nothing. More kissing. - Okay, okay. What exactly is bothering you. Well, it's kind of hard to explain. For example, once. when Charlie and I were at camp... ...I lost my swim trunks, and I ha. to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and... ...I just couldn't enjo. the pool at all. So, what are you saying. I'm a pair of used swim trunks. No, no. In this case. I think you would be the pool. Maybe this was a bad idea. No, no, it's a great idea. It's right up there... ...with the wheel, fire and refrigerator. that give ice through the door. - Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore. - What? Why. You can't be with me without it bein. some competition with your brother. It's not a competition. And even it was, shouldn't we do i. first before you decide who wins. You are unbelievable. - That could be taken a couple of ways. - Get out. Well, no ambiguity there. Don't forget your brother's CD. My eye. Man, I love sunsets. The way the sky is streaked with color. It's amazing. It's the pollution that make. those pretty colors, you know. What you're enjoying is the effec. of light passing through airborne poison. No, that's no. what I'm really enjoying. Boy, I hope that's guacamole
